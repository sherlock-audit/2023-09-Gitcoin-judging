# Registry.updateProfileName() fails to transfer funds from the old anchor to the new one, as a result, funds might be lost in the old anchor.
``Registry.updateProfileName()`` fails to transfer funds from the old anchor to the new one, as a result, funds might be lost in the old anchor. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The anchor of a profile allows the profile owner to use the anchor as a proxy contract to receive funds and call transactions. 

The owner of a profile can call ``Registry.updateProfileName()`` to change the name of a profile and create a new anchor for the profile.  

[https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L177-L203](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L177-L203)

The new anchor will be assigned to ``profile.anchor`` and the existing anchor-to-profile mapping ``anchorToProfileId[Oldanchor]``  will be cleared for the old anchor.  Therefore, the registry will lose track of  the old anchor.  Meanwhile,  ``Registry.updateProfileName()`` fails to transfer funds from the old anchor to the new one. As a result, funds will be lost in the old anchor. 

What should be done is: when ``Registry.updateProfileName()``  is called, native tokens should be transferred from the old anchor to the new one!

## Impact
``Registry.updateProfileName()`` fails to transfer funds from the old anchor to the new one,  funds might be lost in the old anchor.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
``Registry.updateProfileName()`` needs  to transfer funds from the old anchor to the new one. A function ``recoverFunds()`` is added to Anchor to achieve this:

```diff
 function updateProfileName(bytes32 _profileId, string memory _name)
        external
        onlyProfileOwner(_profileId)
        returns (address anchor)
    {
        // Generate a new anchor address
        anchor = _generateAnchor(_profileId, _name);

        // Get the profile using the profileId from the mapping
        Profile storage profile = profilesById[_profileId];

        // Set the new name
        profile.name = _name;

        // Remove old anchor
+     address oldAnchor = profile.anchor;
-        anchorToProfileId[profile.anchor] = bytes32(0);

+  if(oldAnchor != anchor) {
+       delete anchorToProfileId[OldAnchor];
+       Anchor(oldAnchor).recoverFunds(anchor);

        // Set the new anchor
        profile.anchor = anchor;
        anchorToProfileId[anchor] = _profileId;

        // Emit the event that the name was updated with the new data
        emit ProfileNameUpdated(_profileId, _name, anchor);
+}

        // Return the new anchor
        return anchor;
    }

 function recoverFunds(address _recipient) external  {
        if (msg.sender != registry) revert Not_called_by_registry();

       _transferAmount( NATIVE, _recipient, address(this).balance);
    }
