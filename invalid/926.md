# RfpCommitteeStrategy._allocate() lacks `onlyActivePool` modifier

`_allocate` which is overridden in RfpCommitteeStrategy from RfpSimple is lacking an important check for whether the pool is active in order to accept new recipient who will be eligible for reward in `_distribute`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability arises from the wrong assumptions of the developers that overridden functions inherit all the modifiers from the parent contract, which in this case is RfpSimple. 

Let’s look at the `_allocate` definition in both contracts:

```solidity
src: [allo-v2/contract/strategies/rfp-simple/RfpSimple.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L386C5-L392C33)

function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender)
internal
virtual
override
nonReentrant
onlyActivePool
onlyPoolManager(_sender)
```

```solidity
src: allo-v2/contract/strategies/rfp-simple/RfpCommitteeStrategy.sol

function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal override onlyPoolManager(_sender) {
```

From there we can state that there won’t be any validation whether the pool is inactive when poolManager calls `_allocate`. 

## Impact

`_allocate` will be callable even when the pool is closed, which is not intended by the docs and protocol sponsors.

### PoC

There is a piece of dummy code to have an overview of the architecture of the 2 contracts (RfpSimple and RfpCommittee), which we discussed with the sponsors and agreed over: 

```solidity
contract TestOverride{
  bool public isActive = false;

  modifier onlyActive{
      if(!isActive){
        revert();
      }
      _;
  }

  function tst() external virtual onlyActive{
      //do smth
  }
}

contract Test is TestOverride{
  function tst() external override{
  //do smth 2x
  }
}
```

## Recommendation

Consider applying `onlyActivePool` in the overridden function as well.
