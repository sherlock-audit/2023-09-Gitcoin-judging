# RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive() does not check that msg.sender is a pool manager
## Summary
`RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive()` does not check the sender permissions (the function comment says that it checks it though).

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive` does not check that `msg.sender` is a pool manager, there is no check in the called function `BaseStrategy._setPoolActive` as well. So, anyone can call the function.

## Impact
Core functions of the strategy (`_allocate`, `_registerRecipient`, `withdraw`) have `onlyActivePool`/`onlyInactivePool` modifiers, so anyone can change the pool state and affect the strategy functions. For example, an attacker can front run calls to `withdraw` and do not allow to withdraw funds.

## Code Snippet

RFPSimpleStrategy.sol:
```solidity
    /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```

BaseStrategy.sol:
```solidity
    /// @notice Set the pool to active or inactive status.
    /// @dev This will emit a 'PoolActive()' event. Used by the strategy implementation.
    /// @param _active The status to set, 'true' means active, 'false' means inactive
    function _setPoolActive(bool _active) internal {
        poolActive = _active;
        emit PoolActive(_active);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Add check for `msg.sender` to the function.
