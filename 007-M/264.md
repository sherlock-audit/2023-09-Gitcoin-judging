# In QV strategy, each pool manager has absolute control over reviewing recipients

`QVBaseStrategy.reviewRecipients` allows any pool manager to cast arbitrarily many votes. In a single transaction, they can force any recipient of their choice to either become  accepted or rejected.

I have checked with the sponsor. They said: "If they can cast more than 1 vote and force the approval, it would be a bug"

## Vulnerability Detail

QVBaseStrategy.reviewRecipients does not contain any form of vote tracking. It does not at all track whether a pool manager has already voted. They can submit many votes for or against the same recipient in the same transaction. If the recipient was rejected, they can be marked as accepted, and vice-versa.

## Impact

The voting mechanism of pool managers in QV strategy is completely broken.

## Recommendation

Only allow one vote per recipient per pool manager.
