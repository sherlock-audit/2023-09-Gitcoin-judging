# Invalid condition: the pool will not be created if the msg.value is strictly equal to the required one value

Invalid condition: the pool will not be created if the msg.value is strictly equal to the required one

## Vulnerability Detail

The comment says that 
// If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
// If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
however, the condition that goes below is designed so that with strict equality the transaction will be reverted

```solidity
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
```

## Impact

The pool will not be created if the msg.value is strictly equal to the required one. That is, the system will not work as planned.

## Recommendation

correct the condition

```solidity
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
```
