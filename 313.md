# Updating the fee while a pool is mid-allocation can cause a mismatch in expected vs actual fees.
## Summary
There can be a mismatch between the expected fee revenue and actual fee revenue collected by the treasury.
## Vulnerability Detail
1. The percentFee variable stores the fee percentage that is deducted from each pool when funded. This is set globally for all pools.
2. When a new pool is created and funded via _fundPool(), it calculates the fee based on the current percentFee: [Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L509-L514)
3. This feeAmount is sent to the treasury. The remaining amountAfterFee is sent to the pool's strategy contract.
4. Now let's say the percentFee is updated via updatePercentFee() while the pool is mid-allocation.
5. The next time new funds are added to the pool via _fundPool(), it will calculate the fee based on the new percentFee.
6. This means the actual fee collected will be different than what was expected based on the old percentFee when the pool was created.

Essentially, the fee logic needs to account for in-flight pools that were created under a different fee scheme. Updating the global fee cannot retroactively change already deducted fees for existing pools.

Now let's look at a scenario:

1. Allo is initialized with 10% percentFee
2. Alice creates Pool A
3. Bob funds Pool A with 1000 DAI
    * 10% of 1000 DAI = 100 DAI is sent to treasury as fee
    * 900 DAI sent to Pool A strategy
4. Alice expects all future funding to deduct 10% fee based on initial percentFee
5. Owner updates percentFee to 5%
6. Carol funds Pool A with 1000 DAI
    * 5% of 1000 DAI = 50 DAI fee (based on new 5% percentFee)
    * 950 DAI sent to Pool A strategy
7. Alice receives less funds than expected. The fee charged was lower than the initial 10% when pool was created.

The key parts of the code are:
1. percentFee variable that stores the global fee percentage: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L48)
2. _fundPool() calculates fee based on current percentFee: [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L509-L514)
3. updatePercentFee() allows changing the percentFee: [Link 3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L227-L229)






## Impact
This can result in less funds being allocated than expected

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
• Disallow updating the fee when there are active pools.
• Lock the fee percentage when a pool is created, so it uses that initial percentage for its lifetime.
• Emit an event any time the fee is updated that pool managers can listen for.
