# QVSimpleStrategy: unlimited voting is possible
## Summary

`allocator.voiceCredits` is never increased. So the check at the line L#121 does not work correctly and the `_sender` can use an unlimited amount of credits.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `QVSimpleStrategy._allocate` function checks if the `_sender` has voice credits left at the line L#121. The max amount of credits is limited by `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` value. But the `allocator.voiceCredits` is never increased. So the `_sender` can call the function many times with `voiceCreditsToAllocate <= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`.
`QVSimpleStrategy._allocate`:
```solidity
121        if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();


122        _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
```
`QVSimpleStrategy._hasVoiceCreditsLeft`:
```solidity
144    function _hasVoiceCreditsLeft(uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate, uint256 _allocatedVoiceCredits)
145        internal
146        view
147        override
148        returns (bool)
149    {
150        return _voiceCreditsToAllocate + _allocatedVoiceCredits <= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator;
151    }
```

## Impact

It is possible to use an unlimited amount of credits for voting, but should not be.

## Recommendation

Consider increasing `allocator.voiceCredits`  after the check at the line L#121.
