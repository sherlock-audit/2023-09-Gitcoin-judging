# Updating the timestamps while the pool is active could have unintended consequences
Updating the timestamps while the pool is active could have unintended consequences..
## Vulnerability Detail
1. The QVBaseStrategy contract has timestamps for the registration and allocation periods: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L88-L91)
2. These can be updated by the pool manager using the updatePoolTimestamps() function: [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L295-L300) and [Link 3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L351-L354)

 If the pool manager calls this during the allocation period to extend the registrationEndTime, new recipients could register and unfairly participate in voting.
 For example, if originally:
      - registrationEndTime was Jan 1
      - allocationStartTime was Jan 2
 And the manager updates during allocation to:
      - registrationEndTime extended to Jan 5
 Any new registrants between Jan 2 and Jan 5 could now participate in voting, even though registration was meant to be closed.

## Impact
Specifically, extending the registration period while voting is happening could allow new registrants to unfairly participate in the voting

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract could add a check in updatePoolTimestamps() to prevent changing timestamps while the pool is active.
