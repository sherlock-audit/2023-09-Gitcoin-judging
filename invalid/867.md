# Eth in `allo.sol` contract can be stolen

Eth in `allo.sol` contract can be stolen due to insufficient checks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `allo.sol` contract is designed to handle both tokens and ETH to fund different strategies. However users can drain any ETH in the Allo contract in the special case where `baseFee` is set to 0. This vulnerability exists in the `_createPool` function.

In this function, the contract checks if the message value passed by the user is sufficient to cover the amount charged as fee and to be sent to the strategy.

```solidity
if (baseFee > 0) {
    // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
    // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
    // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
    if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
        revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
    }
    _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
    emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
}
```

However this check is only done if the baseFee is not zero. If the baseFee is set to 0, these checks are skipped. This means that if the token is NATIVE, the user can draw out more eth than they send to the contract.

After the above checks, which are skipped for `baseFee=0`, the contract sends forward the tokens via the `_fundPool` function.

```solidity
function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
    uint256 feeAmount;
    uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;
    Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
    address _token = pool.token;
    if (percentFee > 0) {
        feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
        amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
    }
    _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
    _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);
}
```

This function does 2 transfers. One is for the fee, and the other is for the remaining amount. The transfers of eth are handled by the `_transferAmountFrom` function, which is from a library.

```solidity
function _transferAmountFrom(address _token, TransferData memory _transferData) internal returns (bool) {
    uint256 amount = _transferData.amount;
    if (_token == NATIVE) {
        // Native Token
        if (msg.value < amount) revert AMOUNT_MISMATCH();

        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_transferData.to, amount);
    } else {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(_token, _transferData.from, _transferData.to, amount);
    }
    return true;
}
```

As seen in the implementation above, the function checks `msg.value` against the `amount`, to make sure the user sends enough eth to cover the transfer. So each call of `_transferAmountFrom` does this check. However the functions are called with smaller amounts than what is expected to be sent out of the contract.

As an example, lets say `percentFee` is 10%, and the amount passed to `_fundPool` is 100 ETH. So `feeAmount` is calculated as 10 ETH, and `amountAfterFee` is 90 ETH. The `_transferAmountFrom` function is called twice, once for the fee, and once for the remaining amount. So the `_transferAmountFrom` will make sure that `msg.value` is more than 10 ETH, and more than 90 ETH. So if the user only sent 91 ETH, the Allo contract will send out the full 100ETH to the strategy, and eat the 9 ETH loss. This is because the total `amount` is never checked against `msg.value` if `baseFee` is 0.

## Impact

Any ETH in Allo.sol contract can be drained out is `baseFee` is set to 0.

## Recommendation

Check `msg.value` against `_amount` outside of the `baseFee` if statement.
