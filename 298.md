# QVBaseStrategy.sol#reviewRecipients() One manager can vote more than once for a recipient
## Summary
One manager can vote more than once for a recipient 

## Vulnerability Detail
reviewRecipients function allows different managers to review the recipients and if the recipient has enough reviews, his status is updated. There is a mapping where the reviews for each recipient are stored, so every time a manager executes reviewRecipients(), the recipient reviews are increased with one. To update a recipient's status, enough managers must have voted for the recipient so that his reviews are equal to or greater than the reviewThreshold variable.

So let's assume that a recipient doesn't have enough reviews to update his status, but the manager can call the function as many times as necessary to increase the count enough to pass the if statement.

## Impact
Any recipient can pass the review process

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function reviewRecipients(address[] calldata _recipientIds, Status[] calldata _recipientStatuses)
        external
        virtual
        onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)
        onlyActiveRegistration
    {
        // make sure the arrays are the same length
        uint256 recipientLength = _recipientIds.length;
        if (recipientLength != _recipientStatuses.length) revert INVALID();


        for (uint256 i; i < recipientLength;) {
            Status recipientStatus = _recipientStatuses[i];
            address recipientId = _recipientIds[i];


            // if the status is none or appealed then revert
            if (recipientStatus == Status.None || recipientStatus == Status.Appealed) {
                revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
            }


            reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus]++;


            if (reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus] >= reviewThreshold) {
                Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
                recipient.recipientStatus = recipientStatus;


                emit RecipientStatusUpdated(recipientId, recipientStatus, address(0));
            }


            emit Reviewed(recipientId, recipientStatus, msg.sender);


            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe a mapping that stores when a manager has reviewed a recipient and if that checks if the manager has already reviewed that recipient
