# In `QVSimpleStrategy` registrations close to the end of the registration period cannot be reviewed by a poolManager
## Summary

If a user registers close to `registrationEndTime` the poolManager will not have enough time to review the registration since `reviewRecipients` can only be called when the registration period is open

## Vulnerability Detail

In `QVSimpleStrategy` users can register themselves as potential recipients during the registration period. To become accepted, the registration needs to be reviewed by a poolManager by calling `reviewRecipients`. The problem is that the function `reviewRecipients` has the modifier `onlyActiveRegistration` meaning it can only be called during the registration period. If a user registers close to the end of the registration period, the pool manager will not have time to review the registration until the registration period ends. 


## Impact

Not all registrations will be reviewed, and the purpose of a registration period will be negated

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding a review period that starts when the registration period starts and ends some time after the registration period is already over. This will give the poolManager enough time to review every registration for the pool.
