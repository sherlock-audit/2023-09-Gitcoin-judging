# Unbounded profile ownership transfers and zero-address assignment scenarios in `updateProfilePendingOwner` and `acceptProfileOwnership` may lead to irretrievable locks and malicious takeovers

The `Registry` CA has been identified to have actual vulnerabilities in its profile ownership management system. Not only does it allow the unrestricted transfer of profile ownership to possibly malicious addresses, but it also does not validate if the profile ID exists when attempting to transfer the ownership. This can lead to a series of unauthorized activities, including the locking of profiles or takeover by unintended entities.

## Vulnerability Detail

> ### 1. Unrestricted profile ownership transfers:

In the `Registry`, the `updateProfilePendingOwner` function allows a current profile owner to nominate a new owner, referred to as a "pending owner". However, this function lacks appropriate constraints:

- **Zero address assignment**: **The function allows the assignment of the zero address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000`) as the pending owner, which can result in profiles becoming irrevocably inaccessible if the ownership transfer is subsequently accepted**.

- **Nonexistent profile transfers**: There's an absence of a check to confirm if the given `_profileId` actually exists in the contract. Thus, an attempt can be made to set a pending owner for an invalid profile, though the practical implications might be negligible.

> ### 2. Ownership acceptance without verification:

The `acceptProfileOwnership` function allows a pending owner to assume ownership of a profile. However, this function has several vulnerabilities:

- **Profile existence validation**: The function doesn't ensure that the given `_profileId` maps to a valid profile. While an attacker attempting to take ownership of a nonexistent profile might fail due to an absence of a corresponding pending owner, it remains a possible vector for disrupting contract state (even its impact is way more limited than `newOwner(0)`).

- **`newOwner(0)` is unchecked**: A crucial omission is the absence of a check to confirm that the `newOwner` (derived from the pending owner mapping) isn't the zero address. Given the aforementioned ability of the `updateProfilePendingOwner` function to assign the zero address as a pending owner, profiles can be permanently lost.

> ### 3. Profile creation (informational.):

The `createProfile` function includes checks for the zero address during profile creation. It ensures that neither the profile `_owner` nor the `_members` are set to the zero address. **However, the vulnerabilities in the ownership transfer functions mean that these checks are insufficient in securing profile ownership throughout the contract's lifecycle**.

## Impact

1. A user can mistakenly or maliciously set a zero address as a pending owner, leading to profiles being irretrievably locked.
   
2. An attacker may trick a user into setting their malicious address as the pending owner, subsequently taking over the profile.
   
3. Due to the absence of profile existence checks, an attacker could eventually exploit the logic to cause unforeseen changes or disruptions in the contract's state.

## Code Snippet

> 1. **`createProfile`**:

- This function checks for the zero address for the `_owner` and `_members`, **but this check is only at the profile creation stage**. 
- The concern **isn't with the `createProfile` function but with the subsequent transfer of ownership**. Therefore, **the zero address check here does not invalidate the identified vulnerabilities in profile ownership management**.

```solidity
   function createProfile(
        uint256 _nonce,
        string memory _name,
        Metadata memory _metadata,
        address _owner,
        address[] memory _members
    ) external returns (bytes32) {
        // Generate a profile ID using a nonce and the msg.sender
        bytes32 profileId = _generateProfileId(_nonce);

        // Make sure the nonce is available
        if (profilesById[profileId].anchor != address(0)) revert NONCE_NOT_AVAILABLE();

        // Make sure the owner is not the zero address
        if (_owner == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

        // Create a new Profile instance, also generates the anchor address
        Profile memory profile = Profile({
            id: profileId,
            nonce: _nonce,
            name: _name,
            metadata: _metadata,
            owner: _owner,
            anchor: _generateAnchor(profileId, _name)
        });

        profilesById[profileId] = profile;
        anchorToProfileId[profile.anchor] = profileId;

        // Assign roles for the profile members
        uint256 memberLength = _members.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < memberLength;) {
            address member = _members[i];

            // Will revert if any of the addresses are a zero address
            if (member == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

            // Grant the role to the member and emit the event for each member
            _grantRole(profileId, member);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        // Emit the event that the profile was created
        emit ProfileCreated(profileId, profile.nonce, profile.name, profile.metadata, profile.owner, profile.anchor);

        // Return the profile ID
        return profileId;
    }
```

> 2. **`updateProfilePendingOwner`**:

- As mentioned, **this function allows the current profile owner to set any address, including the zero address**, as a possible new owner without any checks. This is a significant vulnerability since a profile can be accidentally or maliciously rendered inaccessible by setting its pending owner to the zero address.
- Moreover, **there's no check to ensure that the `_profileId` exists, which means it can also be exploited to set a pending owner for a non-existent profile, though the real-world impact of this might be limited**.

```solidity
function updateProfilePendingOwner(bytes32 _profileId, address _pendingOwner)
 external
 onlyProfileOwner(_profileId)
 {
 profileIdToPendingOwner[_profileId] = _pendingOwner;
 }

function acceptProfileOwnership(bytes32 _profileId) external {
 Profile storage profile = profilesById[_profileId];
 address newOwner = profileIdToPendingOwner[_profileId];
 if (msg.sender != newOwner) revert NOT_PENDING_OWNER();
 profile.owner = newOwner;
 delete profileIdToPendingOwner[_profileId];
 }
```

> 3. **`acceptProfileOwnership`**:

- This function lacks checks for the existence of `_profileId`. An attacker could try to accept ownership of a non-existent profile, but the function would fail because it would not find a corresponding pending owner.
- More crucially, **the function does not check if the `newOwner` is the zero address. Since the `updateProfilePendingOwner` function allows the pending owner to be set to the zero address, the combined effect is that a profile can be permanently locked**.

```solidity
 function acceptProfileOwnership(bytes32 _profileId) external {
        // Get the profile from the mapping
        Profile storage profile = profilesById[_profileId];

        // Get the pending owner from the mapping that was set when the owner was updated
        address newOwner = profileIdToPendingOwner[_profileId];

        // Revert if the 'msg.sender' is not the pending owner
        if (msg.sender != newOwner) revert NOT_PENDING_OWNER();

        // Set the new owner and delete the pending owner from the mapping
        profile.owner = newOwner;
        delete profileIdToPendingOwner[_profileId];

        // Emit the event that the owner was accepted and updated
        emit ProfileOwnerUpdated(_profileId, profile.owner);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual review.

## Recommendation

1. Enhance the `updateProfilePendingOwner` function by adding necessary validations to ensure that `_pendingOwner` is not the zero address, nor any possibly malicious addresses.
   
2. In the `acceptProfileOwnership` function:
   - Ensure that `_profileId` exists.
   - Ascertain that the `newOwner` isn't the zero address.

3. Think about integrating events or alerts to notify profile owners about any attempts or successful transitions in ownership.

1. **Modifying `updateProfilePendingOwner`**:
   
```solidity
function updateProfilePendingOwner(bytes32 _profileId, address _pendingOwner)
    external
    onlyProfileOwner(_profileId)
{
    // Ensure that _pendingOwner is not the zero address
    if (_pendingOwner == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

    // Additional checks can be added here for other malicious addresses

    profileIdToPendingOwner[_profileId] = _pendingOwner;

    emit ProfilePendingOwnerUpdated(_profileId, _pendingOwner);
}
```

2. **Modifying `acceptProfileOwnership`**:

```solidity
function acceptProfileOwnership(bytes32 _profileId) external {
    // Ensure that the _profileId exists
    if (profilesById[_profileId].anchor == address(0)) revert INVALID_PROFILE_ID();

    Profile storage profile = profilesById[_profileId];
    address newOwner = profileIdToPendingOwner[_profileId];

    // Ensure that newOwner is not the zero address
    if (newOwner == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

    if (msg.sender != newOwner) revert NOT_PENDING_OWNER();

    profile.owner = newOwner;
    delete profileIdToPendingOwner[_profileId];

    emit ProfileOwnerUpdated(_profileId, profile.owner);
}
```

3. **Adding events**:

Though the contract already has events like `ProfilePendingOwnerUpdated` and `ProfileOwnerUpdated`, you might consider adding more events that capture every significant state change, such as:

```solidity
event AttemptedOwnershipChange(bytes32 indexed _profileId, address indexed _attemptedBy, address _intendedPendingOwner);
```

This event can be emitted right before the actual state change in `updateProfilePendingOwner` to notify whenever someone tries to change ownership, regardless of success.

By implementing this logic, should be able to prevent the issue.

## POC

1. Deploy the `Registry` contract.
2. Initiate a profile via the `createProfile` function.
3. Use the `updateProfilePendingOwner` function to nominate a zero address (or another address) as the pending owner.
4. Accept the ownership transfer from the nominated address using `acceptProfileOwnership`.

> Get a script to validate the intended behavior, for instance:

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
    const [deployer, user, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const ZERO_ADDRESS = "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000";

    // Deploy Registry contract
    const Registry = await ethers.getContractFactory("Registry");
    const registry = await Registry.deploy();
    await registry.deployed();

    // Print out the deployed addresses
    console.log("Registry deployed to:", registry.address);
    console.log("Deployer Address:", deployer.address);
    console.log("User Address:", user.address);
    console.log("Attacker Address:", attacker.address);

    // User creates a profile
    const nonce = 1;
    const name = "User's Profile";
    const metadata = {};  // Replace with appropriate metadata if needed
    const createTx = await registry.connect(user).createProfile(nonce, name, metadata, user.address, []);
    const createReceipt = await createTx.wait();
    const profileId = createReceipt.events.find(e => e.event === "ProfileCreated").args.id;

    // User sets zero address as the pending owner
    await registry.connect(user).updateProfilePendingOwner(profileId, ZERO_ADDRESS);

    // Zero address (or attacker) accepts the profile ownership
    try {
        await registry.connect(attacker).acceptProfileOwnership(profileId);  // This should fail due to the ZERO_ADDRESS validation, instead, it will succeed
        console.log("Exploit succeeded!");
    } catch (e) {
        console.log("Exploit failed:", e.message);
    }
}

main()
    .then(() => process.exit(0))
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
        process.exit(1);
    });
```

> To run the PoC:

1. Save the above script in a new file, e.g., `exploit.js` in the root of your env directory.
2. Run it using `npx hardhat run exploit.js`.

This script deploys the `Registry` CA, creates a profile, sets the (0) as the pending owner, and then attempts to take ownership from the zero address. As we previously discussed, **setting the zero address should be urgently blocked to prevent accidental or malicious profile lockouts**.
