# Accepted recipient can always change status of milestone even if the milestone status is rejected
## Summary

In `RFPSimpleStrategy` an accepted recipient can submit upcoming milestones with `submitUpcomingMilestone`, which sets the current `upcomingMilestone`'s metadata and status

```solidity
function submitUpcomingMilestone(Metadata calldata _metadata) external {
        // Check if the 'msg.sender' is the 'acceptedRecipientId' and is a member of the 'Profile'
        if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender && !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)) {
            revert UNAUTHORIZED();
        }

        // Check if the upcoming milestone is in fact upcoming
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

        // Get the milestone and update the metadata and status
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        milestone.metadata = _metadata;

        // Set the milestone status to 'Pending' to indicate that the milestone is submitted
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Pending;

        // Emit event for the milestone
        emit MilstoneSubmitted(upcomingMilestone);
    }
```

## Vulnerability Detail

The problem is that a pool manager can reject a milestone, but the accepted recipient can resubmit it and set it's status to pending again, because there are no checks on the `submitUpcomingMilestone` to check if a milestone has been rejected or not.

## Impact

Pool manager is powerless in terms of milestone rejecting, the accepted recipient can always set status to milestone as pending and fulfil it
