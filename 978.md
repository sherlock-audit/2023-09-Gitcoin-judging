# Voters can vote multiple times
## Summary
The `_qv_allocate` function in `QVBaseStrategy.sol`, there is no logic to decrease the allocators `voiceCredits` which they are checked to have in the `_allocate()` function. This allows the voters to continue casting votes that they might not have by calling the function multiple times with their votes.

## Vulnerability Detail
Voters can vote multiple times because their credits aren't updated.
``` solidity
        // update the values
        voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
        totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
        _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;

        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
        _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;

        // emit the event with the vote results
        emit Allocated(_recipientId, voteResult, _sender);
    }
```
## Impact
The logic for `_qv_allocate` updates the values `voteResult`, `totalRecipientVotes`, `_recipient.totalVotesReceived` but doesn't decrease the `allocator.voteCredits`, meaning the balance of the allocator's voice credits remains the same.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the allocator.voiceCredits by decreasing it by the `voiceCreditsToAllocate` before `_qv_allocate` is called.
