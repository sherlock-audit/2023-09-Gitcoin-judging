# Use  Ownership2stepUpgradable instead of Ownable

Using Ownership2stepUpgradable is a best practice and  a secure way compared to single step Ownable pattern    

## Vulnerability Detail

Single-step ownership transfer means that if a wrong address was passed when transferring ownership or admin rights it can mean that role is lost forever. The ownership pattern implementation for the protocol is in `Ownable.sol` where a single-step transfer is implemented.This can be a problem for all methods marked in `onlyOwner` throughout the protocol, some of which are core protocol functionality.


## Impact


High, because important protocol functionality will be bricked ,likelihood
low, because it requires an error on the admin side
