# Anyone can toggle the pool status for `RFPSimpleStrategy`
Only pool managers are allowed to update the pool status in `RFPSimpleStrategy`. However, there is no access control restriction on `setPoolActive`, so anyone can update the pool status. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Only pool managers should be able to update pool status, but the `onlyPoolManager` modifier is missing. Anyone can set the pool to active or inactive states. 

```solidity
/// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
/// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
/// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
}
```

## Impact
A malicious user can interfere by setting the pool with incorrect statuses and DOS a pool manager who is trying to register recipients, allocate, distribute, and withdraw.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the `onlyPoolManager` modifier to restrict access:

```solidity
function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
}
```
