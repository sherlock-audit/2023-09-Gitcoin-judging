# RFP strategy malicious recipient can undermine metadata by reentrancy
## Summary
A malicious recipient can submit a milestone with metadata and counterfeit the metadata during `_distribute()` disabling the managers from rejecting the milestone. 
## Vulnerability Detail
An accepted recipient can execute `submitUpcomingMilestone(Metadata calldata _metadata)` and provide metadata for the upcoming milestone, if the owner / managers of the pool are not pleased with the provided metadata `rejectMilestone(uint256 _milestoneId)` can be executed to Reject the milestone and wait for another submit with different metadata. The issue here is that a malicious recipient can submit a milestone with proper metadata, however, when `_distribute()` is called to finalize the milestone  `milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;` &  `upcomingMilestone++;` are called after the funds transfer to the recipient - at the moment of funds transfer (if `Native` token) the recipient can reenter `submitUpcomingMilestone(Metadata calldata _metadata)` and change the metadata for the same milestone that is being distributed thus disabling the admin / managers from acting upon the change in metadata.
```solidity
function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {
        //code ....
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

        // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;

        // Increment the upcoming milestone
        upcomingMilestone++;

        // Emit events for the milestone and the distribution
        emit MilestoneStatusChanged(upcomingMilestone, Status.Accepted);
        emit Distributed(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
    }
```
## Impact
Malicious metadata can be injected during distribution of a milestone
