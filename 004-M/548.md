# Math error in  `_qv_allocate`
Math error in  `_qv_allocate`,  `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId` seems wrong calculated.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 
   function _qv_allocate(
        Allocator storage _allocator,
        Recipient storage _recipient,
        address _recipientId,
        uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate,
        address _sender
    ) internal onlyActiveAllocation {
        // check the `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` is > 0
        if (_voiceCreditsToAllocate == 0) revert INVALID();

        // get the previous values
 @>       uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
        uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId];

        // get the total credits and calculate the vote result
@>        uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
        uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);

        // update the values
        voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
        totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
        _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;

@>        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
        _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;

        // emit the event with the vote results
        emit Allocated(_recipientId, voteResult, _sender);
    }
    
 
```
Seems that  ` _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;`   logic  is wrong.
It should be
` _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] = totalCredits;`
because in previous calculation , 
```solidity
 uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]
 ``` 
the origin logic double  add `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]`
 


## Impact 
Due to the error value of    `creditsCastToRecipient`  in  `_qv_allocate` , if   `_qv_allocate`  is  allocated twice or more times,  he will get a much higher  voteResults than intend , and get more payouts.

## Recommendation
change to 

` _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] = totalCredits;`
