# createPoolWithCustomStrategy in Allo.sol is reentrant
## Summary
Unlike `createPool` which has a `nonReentrant` check, `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` doesn't have the same check in place
## Vulnerability Detail
Re-entrancy vulnerability.
## Impact
1) With two methods trying to achieve similar result in a different fashion, have them different like that might lead to confusion or potential issues down the road, especially if `_createPool` is modified.
2) `_createPool` could potentially allow re-entrancy
