# Possible  token  lock after `fundPool`
Possible  token  lock after `fund` ï¼Œbecase there is no limitation of  `fundPool`  and lack of withdraw function in some strategy.
## Vulnerability Detail
In   `Allo.sol` , anyone can increase the fund  amount by fundpool 
```solidity 
function fundPool(uint256 _poolId, uint256 _amount) external payable nonReentrant {
        // if amount is 0, revert with 'NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS()' error
        if (_amount == 0) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();

        // Call the internal fundPool() function
        _fundPool(_amount, _poolId, pools[_poolId].strategy);
    }
   ```
 And different strategies have different method  to distribute   token . Some strategies don't have  `withdraw` function . If user fund pool at an unintended time, the token would get stuck.
  Take a look at   strategy `QVBaseStrategy` , the lifecycle of token is 
```solidity
   fundpool ->  allocate->distribute  
  
```
 User could fundpool after  allocate  or after distribute ,both ways could lead to  token can not fully distribute or get stuck in contract.

 
## Impact
 Token is lock  in  strategy who don't have  withdraw function.
