# Empty pool can be created by passing zero amount
## Summary
Allo._createPool is responsible for creating pool, ensuring that ID of the profile of pool creator in the registry belongs to the caller i.e; msg.sender  than it increment `poolIndex` , after that it is generating the manager & admin roles for the pool ,next it is creating the Pool instance and granting manager and admin role later it calls  `_strategy.initialize` which is expected to revert when invoked more than once with 'ALREADY_INITIALIZED()' error  next it is granting pool managers roles to the manager array than it transfer `baseFee` to `treasury` and at last it calls `_fundPool` to fund the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem with `_createPool` arises at last when it make a call to `_fundPool` internal function after checking `_amount > 0` that is amount deposited in the pool during creation time should be greater than zero,

#L480
```solidity
 if (_amount > 0) {
            _fundPool(_amount, poolId, _strategy);
        }
```
this can lead to creating a pool with empty amount deposited because of the check
#L453 
```solidity
        // initialize strategies
        // Initialization is expected to revert when invoked more than once with 'ALREADY_INITIALIZED()' error
        _strategy.initialize(poolId, _initStrategyData);
``` 
which makes the function only call once after user make a call to `createPool` function, after which user will unable to call `createPool` function again even if they pass zero as amount OR createPool can be initialized with amount = 0. Because a subsequent call to `initialize` can only happen once, the contract is now initialized with a zero size pool that does not allow any liquidity to be added.

## Impact
` createPool` can only be called once due to a check  `_strategy.initialize`, this call may leave the pool empty.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L480
```solidity
 if (_amount > 0) {
            _fundPool(_amount, poolId, _strategy);
        }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Require a minimum amount to be provided when creating a Pool.
