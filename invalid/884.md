# Malicious user can front-run the strategy to DOS it or steal it to save gas.
To create a pool with `createPoolWithCustomStrategy`, user need to deploy a `strategy`.

After deploying the `strategy`, malicious user can front-run `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` to use the deployed strategy or prevent the deployer from using it.

## Vulnerability Detail
To call `createPoolWithCustomStrategy`, user must pass the address of the strategy as an argument.

Therefore, it is necessary to deploy the strategy before calling `createPoolWithCustomStrategy`.

A malicious user could discover the strategy deploy and call `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` with it as an argument first. If they want to use that strategy, they can save gas by running it first.

Also, since the strategy is initialized inside `createPoolWithCustomStrategy`, it is possible to do a DoS attack to prevent the deployer from being used.

## Impact
Malicious user can front-run `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` to save gas on strategy deployment. 
Also malicious user can cause DoS.
