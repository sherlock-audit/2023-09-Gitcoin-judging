# Funds can be trapped in the vault strategy
## Summary
Funds can be trapped in the vault strategy when using fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Allo contracts are expected to operate with **any** type of ERC-20 tokens. In [DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-distribution-vault/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol#L107-L136), an **amount** of tokens is transferred from an allocator to the contract. Then the same amount is saved in a mapping, ready to be withdrawn by its recipient. If an account allocates tokens to a vault that uses fee-on-transfer tokens, the recipient won't be able to withdraw the funds and they will be stuck in the contract.

## Impact
Funds cannot be withdrawn.

## Code Snippet
```jsx
function _afterAllocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal override {
        // Decode the '_data' to get the recipientId, amount and token
        (address recipientId, Permit2Data memory p2Data) = abi.decode(_data, (address, Permit2Data));

        // Get the token address
        address token = p2Data.permit.permitted.token;
        uint256 amount = p2Data.permit.permitted.amount;

        if (token == NATIVE) {
            if (msg.value < amount) {
                revert AMOUNT_MISMATCH();
            }
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(address(this), amount);
        } else {
            PERMIT2.permitTransferFrom(
                // The permit message.
                p2Data.permit,
                // The transfer recipient and amount.
                ISignatureTransfer.SignatureTransferDetails({to: address(this), requestedAmount: amount}),
                // Owner of the tokens and signer of the message.
                _sender,
                // The packed signature that was the result of signing
                // the EIP712 hash of `_permit`.
                p2Data.signature
            );
        }

        // Update the total payout amount for the claim
        claims[recipientId][token] += amount;
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of adding the **amount** to the mapping value, store the difference between the balance of the contract after and before transferring in a variable and add that variable to the mapping value.
