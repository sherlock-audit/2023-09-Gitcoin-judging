# Not cleaned votes to other recipient statuses
Not cleaned votes to other recipient statuses

## Vulnerability Detail
When pool managers approve the status of a recipient, the votes for other statuses are not cleared. This leaves open the possibility for managers to continue voting for other statuses and potentially change the recipient's status in the future.

More than one status can be bigger than `reviewThreshold` and status of recipient can changed everyime. When recipientStatus is setted it should not be changed.

## Impact
Wrongly setting of status.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L273

```solidity
 for (uint256 i; i < recipientLength;) {
            Status recipientStatus = _recipientStatuses[i];
            address recipientId = _recipientIds[i];

            // if the status is none or appealed then revert
            if (recipientStatus == Status.None || recipientStatus == Status.Appealed) {
                revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
            }

            reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus]++;

            if (reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus] >= reviewThreshold) {
                Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
                recipient.recipientStatus = recipientStatus;

                emit RecipientStatusUpdated(recipientId, recipientStatus, address(0));
            }

            emit Reviewed(recipientId, recipientStatus, msg.sender);

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
```
