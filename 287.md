# Pool creation always charges more than necessary
## Summary
If a `baseFee` is set in `Allo`, the implementation of `_createPool()` which is used by `createPoolWithCustomStrategy()` and `createPool()` requires more funds than necessary and thus always incurs (albeit small) loss for the pool owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
The following implementation takes care of charging `baseFee` upon pool creation:

The condition of the `if` statement is written in such a way that even if pool owner provides sufficient funds (`amount` + `baseFee`), they would not satisfy the condition and thus would not be able to successfully create a pool. The transaction would revert with `NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS()` error.

In order to succeed, the function must be called with at least `1 wei` more than necessary. The error itself is also not descriptive enough and does not hint the pool owner what is the expected amount (which is incorrect) and this could lead pool owners depositing more funds than necessary and incurring unnecessary fund loss for them.

## Impact
- Loss of funds for pool owners
- Gas cost losses due to failed transaction executions

## Recommendation
Fix the `if` condition as follows:
```solidity
        if (baseFee > 0) {
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) { //@audit Fix the if condition
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
```
