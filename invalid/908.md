# Rejected milestones can be distributed

Rejected milestones can be distributed and `acceptedRecipientId` will receive each milestone amount if the pool has enough amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function is intended to distribute the `upcomingMilestone` amount, but there is no check if the `upcomingMilestone` was rejected. 

The function starts with this check, but if the `upcomingMilestone` was previously rejected, it will pass. 

```solidity
// check to make sure there is a pending milestone
if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();
```

And from there: 

- the whole `rejectMilestone()` defeats its purpose because `acceptedRecipientId` can submit an invalid `upcomingMilestone` and it can still be used in _distribute.
- A milestone that was set by the pool manager and not submitted by `acceptedRecipientId` will continue to be valid in _distribute.

## Impact

Funds from the pool will be distributed incorrectly and the recipient may receive a rejected `milestone.amountPercentage` of the pool.

## Recommendation

```diff
/// @notice Distribute the upcoming milestone to acceptedRecipientId.
/// @dev '_sender' must be a pool manager to distribute.
/// @param _sender The sender of the distribution
function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
    internal
    virtual
    override
    onlyInactivePool
    onlyPoolManager(_sender)
{
    // check to make sure there is a pending milestone
    if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

+   if(milestones[upcomingMilestone].milestoneStatus == Status.Rejected) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

    IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
    Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
    Recipient memory recipient = _recipients[acceptedRecipientId];

    // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
    if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();

    // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
    uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;

    // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
    poolAmount -= amount;
    _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

    // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
    milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;

    // Increment the upcoming milestone
    upcomingMilestone++;

    // Emit events for the milestone and the distribution
    emit MilestoneStatusChanged(upcomingMilestone, Status.Accepted);
    emit Distributed(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
}
