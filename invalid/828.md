# Profile owners can set pending ownership for themselves in the same block/timeframe a new owner accepts ownership at `updateProfilePendingOwner`
Functions updateProfilePendingOwner & acceptProfileOwnership have a race exploit vulnerability which can lead to the initial profile owner having a pending ownership transfer they can accept at any time after transferring ownership to the new owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability presents itself specifically in the updateProfilePendingOwner where a profile owner can set up the address of a new owner to transfer a profile/registry to. When an address is set, the owner of the address can call acceptProfileOwnership to accept/transfer ownership to themselves. But the previous owner can exploit this by calling updateProfilePendingOwner in the same block/time the new owner calls acceptProfileOwnership.

## Impact
When both updateProfilePendingOwner & acceptProfileOwnership are called simultaneously, weird things will happen to the state of profile ownership.

The user transferring ownership can have a pending ownership for themself to reclaim at a later time without needing the input of the new profile owner
The new profile owner will initially claim ownership that they can lose at any time if the previous owner decides to become malicious for any reason.

These code blocks are impacted by this issue:
```solidity
function updateProfilePendingOwner(bytes32 _profileId, address _pendingOwner)
        external
        onlyProfileOwner(_profileId)
    {
        profileIdToPendingOwner[_profileId] = _pendingOwner;
        emit ProfilePendingOwnerUpdated(_profileId, _pendingOwner);
    }

  function acceptProfileOwnership(bytes32 _profileId) external {
        Profile storage profile = profilesById[_profileId];
        address newOwner = profileIdToPendingOwner[_profileId];
        if (msg.sender != newOwner) revert NOT_PENDING_OWNER();
        profile.owner = newOwner;
        delete profileIdToPendingOwner[_profileId];
        emit ProfileOwnerUpdated(_profileId, profile.owner);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There are a couple of ways to address this issue but the best that comes to mind is a timelock for when the user transferring ownership can call updateProfilePendingOwner after first calling the function.
