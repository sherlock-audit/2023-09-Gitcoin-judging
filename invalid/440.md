# Native tokens sent directly to  `RFPSimpleStrategy` would be locked.
RFPSimpleStrategy is meant to receive native tokens, but any native token sent to the contract would be stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail
RFPSimpleStrategy implements `receive` fallback so that eth could also be sent directly to the contract.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L500
```solidity
/// @notice This contract should be able to receive native token
    receive() external payable {}
```
The issue is that eth sent to this contract cannot be retrieved and would be locked within the contract.
The three possible way to transfer ETH out is not possible with the current implementation.
1) Using withdraw
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L295
```solidity
/// @notice Withdraw funds from pool.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to withdraw funds.
    /// @param _amount The amount to be withdrawn
    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) onlyInactivePool {
        // Decrement the pool amount
@>      poolAmount -= _amount;

        // Transfer the amount to the pool manager
        _transferAmount(allo.getPool(poolId).token, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```
You can see that `withdraw` substracts amount from `poolAmount` which does not account for ETH sent directly to the contract.
2. Using `_distribute`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L417
```solidity
    function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {
        ...SNIP

        // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
@>      poolAmount -= amount;
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

        // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;

        // Increment the upcoming milestone
        upcomingMilestone++;

        // Emit events for the milestone and the distribution
        emit MilestoneStatusChanged(upcomingMilestone, Status.Accepted);
        emit Distributed(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
    }
```
_distribute also substracts from `poolAmount`.
3. Contract inherits [Transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/libraries/Transfer.sol#L28)
All functions defined within `Transfer` are internal functions and are not exposed anywhere within the contracts and inherited contracts as well.

## Impact
Native tokens directly sent to `RFPSimpleStrategy` would be stuck.

## Recommendation
Consider reverting when receive ETH from a msg.sender that is not `Allo`.
