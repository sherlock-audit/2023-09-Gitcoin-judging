# If an allocator is removed in `QVSimpleStrategy` his votes are still counted
## Summary
If an allocator in `QVSimpleStrategy` has voted and is removed after wards, his votes are still counted.


## Vulnerability Detail

In `QVSimpleStrategy` a poolManager can add addresses as `allocators` and give them the right to vote which recipient will get a part of the pool. The poolManager can also remove an `allocator` if he wants to exclude the allocator from the voting. The problem is that if the allocator that should be removed already voted, his votes are still counted since they are not removed when removing the allocator.   

## Impact

Votes of allocators that should be excluded from the voting are still considered in the final result and will thereby influence the distribution of the pool

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If an allocator is removed, also reduce the votes `_recipient.totalVotesReceived` for the recipients he voted for, reduce the `totalRecipientVotes` and delete the values for the allocators in the mappings `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` and `_allocator.votesCastToRecipient`
