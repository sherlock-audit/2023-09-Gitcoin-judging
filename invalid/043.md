# Allo.sol#fundPool will always revert because missing approve
Function `fundPool` will always revert because there no have approve from user to Allo contract to spend his tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
In `_fundPool` contract using `_transferAmountFrom` function to send tokens from user to `treasury` and `_strategy` but there no have approve from user to Allo contract to spend his tokens and function will always revert which will bricks the entire function.
## Impact
Users can't fund pool and can't create pool because missing approve from users to contract to spend his tokens

## Tool used
>PoC
```solidity
function testExpectRevert_createPool() public {
        allo().addToCloneableStrategies(strategy);

        vm.prank(pool_admin());
        vm.expectRevert();
        allo().createPool(
            poolProfile_id(),
            strategy,
            "0x",
            address(token),
            100e18,
            metadata,
            pool_managers()
        );
    }
   ```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adding aprove request before make transferFrom
```diff
function _fundPool(
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _poolId,
        IStrategy _strategy
    ) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;
+      _token.approve(address(this), _amount);
      //code
}
```
