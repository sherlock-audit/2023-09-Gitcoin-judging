# In `RFPSimpleStrategy` the `poolAmount` must always be bigger or equal to the proposal bid of the recipient even parts of the pool were already distributed
## Summary

When the pool manager wants to distribute payments to the recipient, the `poolAmount` must be bigger or equal to 100% of the proposal bid of the recipient even parts of the pool were already distributed


## Vulnerability Detail

The payout of the pool amount in the `RFPSimpleStrategy` is linked to specific mile stones where each mile stone represents a specific percentage of the proposalBid been paid out. E.g. if mile stone 1 is reached 70% of the proposalBid is payed out and if milestone 2 is reached the remaining 30% are paid out. The problem is that when the pool manager calles `_distribute`, the function reverts if 
` recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount`. 

` if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS(); `
This requires the pool to hold 100% of the `proposalBid`, even if some of the mile stones were already accomplished and the corresponding tokens paid out. This makes it necessary for the poolManager to fund the pool with the amount of tokens that were already paid out for previous mile stones to be able to pay out future mile stones.  

## Impact

The poolManager will need to fund the pool with additional funds equal to the already paid out amount to be able to distribute the payment for all mile stones.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When calling _distribute, only revert if the poolAmount is smaller than the amount that needs to be paid out for the upcoming milestone and ignore the propsalBid of the recipient.
