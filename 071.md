# RFPSimpleStrategy `submitUpcomingMilestone` may submit the rejected status milestone
## Summary
The RFPSimpleStrategy contract has a security vulnerability in the `submitUpcomingMilestone` method where it directly updates the status of a milestone to `Status.Pending` without performing any pre-status checks. This poses a risk because the milestone might have already been rejected.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the `submitUpcomingMilestone` function, the milestone is retrieved using `upcomingMileStone` as the array index, and its status are updated to `Status.Pending` without verifying the previous status. 
This means that a milestone could be wrongly submitted even if it had previously been rejected. This vulnerability has a significant impact since, in the subsequent `_distribute` function, the incorrect payment will be distributed to the `recipientAddress`, leading to severe consequences.

## Impact
1. Incorrect Status Update: The vulnerability allows for the direct update of a milestone's status to `Status.Pending` without verifying its previous status. As a result, milestones that have already been rejected can be erroneously marked as pending, leading to a misrepresentation of their actual status. This can cause confusion and misinterpretation of the project's progress, potentially leading to incorrect decision-making or actions based on inaccurate information.
2. Flawed Payment Distribution: The subsequent `_distribute` function relies on the correct status of milestones to determine payment distribution. With the vulnerability present, if a rejected milestone is wrongly marked as pending, incorrect payments will be disbursed to the associated recipientAddress. This can result in financial losses, payment discrepancies, and potential disputes between project stakeholders.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function submitUpcomingMilestone(Metadata calldata _metadata) external {
        // Check if the 'msg.sender' is the 'acceptedRecipientId' and is a member of the 'Profile'
        if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender && !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)) {
            revert UNAUTHORIZED();
        }

        // Check if the upcoming milestone is in fact upcoming
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

        // Get the milestone and update the metadata and status
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        milestone.metadata = _metadata;

        // Set the milestone status to 'Pending' to indicate that the milestone is submitted
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Pending;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before update milestone metadata and status, add check for previous of milestone.
```solidity
        // Check if the upcoming milestone is in fact upcoming
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();
        
        // Get the milestone and update the metadata and status
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        // Check the milestone status
        if (milestone.milestoneStatus == Status.Rejected) {
            revert MILESTONE_ALREADY_REJECTED();
        }
        milestone.metadata = _metadata;

        // Set the milestone status to 'Pending' to indicate that the milestone is submitted
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Pending;

        // Emit event for the milestone
        emit MilstoneSubmitted(upcomingMilestone);
