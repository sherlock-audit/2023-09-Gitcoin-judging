# User can frontrun RFPSimpleStrategy._allocate in order to increase his bid
User can frontrun RFPSimpleStrategy._allocate in order to increase his bid
## Vulnerability Detail
When RFPSimpleStrategy is deployed, then there is `maxBid` variable which is max amount that owner  would like to pay for a job done.
So in order to get this offer users will likely send lower bids. In order to apply user calls `_registerRecipient`. This function allows user [to update info as well](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L372). So user can easily update his bid.

When owner calls `_allocate` then he provides the one who is selected to the job. In this moment owner has agreed payment. But malicious recipient can frontrun `_allocate` and call `_registerRecipient` with new higher bid. As result he will receive bigger payment if owner will not notice that. Or owner will see that and they will start arguing.
## Impact
Recipient may receive bigger paymnet than agreed by owner.

## Recommendation
Make owner provide additional param to `allocate` function. This will be agreed payment. So in case if recipient's bid is bigger than revert.
