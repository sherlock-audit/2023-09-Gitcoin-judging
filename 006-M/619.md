# Tokens cannot be distributed to recipient as expected in RFPSimpleStrategy
Tokens cannot be distributed to recipient as expected in RFPSimpleStrategy

## Vulnerability Detail
Before distributing tokens to the recipient, the first step is to check whether there are enough tokens in the Strategy (line 432). However, the checking here is incorrect. recipient.proposalBid represents the total amount of tokens the recipient requires. Since tokens are distributed milestone by milestone, poolAmount should be compared to the remaining amount of tokens, not the total bid amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a variable, such as recipient.proposalfunded,  represents the amount of tokens has distributed to recipient. line 432 is changed to 
```solidity
if (recipient.proposalBid - recipient.proposalfunded > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
```
