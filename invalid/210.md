# Users can accidentally send too much tokens to the treasury with the fee cut.
## Summary
Users can accidentally send too much tokens to the treasury with the fee cut.
## Vulnerability Detail
If an update fee transaction gets executed before fund pool transaction the user who funded the pool will lose a bigger percentage of his tokens, than he originally accounted for.

1. User send a TX to [fund the pool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L339-L345) with 1000 DAI with current fee of 0%
2. Owner sends a TX to [update the fee percentage](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L227-L229) from 0% to 20%
3. Owner TX gets executed first, due to:
- Re-org on the chain
- Higher gas payment
- User TX being stuck in the mem pool for quite a while 
4. User accidentally send **200 DAI** to the treasury and **800 DAI** to the pool due to [this fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L509-L514) being updated. If he knew the fee would be 20% he would have never funded the pool.

Same applies for [updateBaseFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L234-L236).
## Impact
Loss of funds for the user.

## Code Snippet
```jsx
        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();// _amount * percentFee / 1e18
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For those kinds of state updates it is recommended to use time-lock or use some slippage protection and deadline for the user.
