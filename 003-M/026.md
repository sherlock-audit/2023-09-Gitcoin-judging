# _hasVoiceCreditsLeft check is not working
## Summary
Due to a not working check in **QVSimpleStrategy.sol** , allocators can allocate votes for free.

## Vulnerability Detail
In **QVSimpleStrategy.sol** there is a [function](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/8a41a342a0de7a2d5d7dbc5395d1da44cb811348/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L107-L124) that allows allocators to vote for certain receivers.  [Here](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/8a41a342a0de7a2d5d7dbc5395d1da44cb811348/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L121)  it checks if the current allocator has voice credits left and if that is the case, voting value is delegated to the desired recipient. 

The problem is that the **voiceCredits** of the allocator are left unchanged, so they will always be **0**. This lets the allocator vote as many times as he wants to with **maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator** credits.


## Impact

Allocators can vote for free as many times as they want to.

## Code Snippet

```jsx
 function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal virtual override {
        (address recipientId, uint256 voiceCreditsToAllocate) = abi.decode(_data, (address, uint256));

        // spin up the structs in storage for updating
        Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
        Allocator storage allocator = allocators[_sender];

        // check that the sender can allocate votes
        if (!_isValidAllocator(_sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();

        // check that the recipient is accepted
        if (!_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId)) revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);

        // check that the recipient has voice credits left to allocate
        if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();

        _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
 }
```

```jsx
function _hasVoiceCreditsLeft(uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate, uint256 _allocatedVoiceCredits)
        internal
        view
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        return _voiceCreditsToAllocate + _allocatedVoiceCredits <= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the following line in **qv_allocate** in [**QVBaseStrategy.sol**](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/8a41a342a0de7a2d5d7dbc5395d1da44cb811348/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L531) after making the allocation : 

```jsx
_allocator.voiceCredits = totalCredits;
```
