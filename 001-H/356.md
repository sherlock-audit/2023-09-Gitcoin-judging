# Anyone can grief function execution by setting poolActive flag in RFPSimpleStrategy

An unprotected function allows anyone to set critical state, preventing execution of critical functions which rely on an expected state.

## Vulnerability Detail

`RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive` should be a protected function, but instead anyone can call it. Some important functions can only be executed if the `poolActive` flag is in a specific state: `withdraw`, `registerRecipient`, `_allocate`, `_distribute`. Since anyone can set that state, anyone can prevent function execution by flipping the flag to the incorrect state immediately before the function is executed.

## Impact

Execution of critical functions can be prevented by any user, resulting in reverts and requiring atomically setting the correct `poolActive` state immediately before calling these critical functions for execution to proceed.

function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
    _setPoolActive(_flag);
    emit PoolActive(_flag);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`setPoolActive` should be protected by an `onlyPoolManager` modifier as presumably intended.
