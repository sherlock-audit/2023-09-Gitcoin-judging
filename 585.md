# In QVBaseStrategy, pool time stamps can’t be updated because always revert
## Summary

In the QVBasestrategy there is a logic error that causes the `_updatePoolTimeStamps` function to always revert. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The error is in the use of the basic function `>` which should use `<`, in the `block.timestamp > _registrationStartTime` section. In the `_ isPoolActive` function it is explained that the condition for a pool to be said to be active is `registrationStartTime <= block.timestamp && block.timestamp <= registrationEndTime`, whereas this is contrary to the logic in the `_updatePoolTimeStamps` function. This can cause the `_updatePoolTimeStamps` function to always revert due to incorrect logic and the pool time stamps are never updated.

## Impact

Pool time stamps can’t be updated because always revert.
