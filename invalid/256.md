# QV strategy cannot receive native token

The RFP and DonationMerkle strategies have a receive() method so that they can be funded with native token.  The QV strategy does not, and therefore it is incompatible with the native token.

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary

## Impact

Cannot use QV strategy with native token.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L574

Notice the lack of a receive() method, which is also lacking in QVSimpleStrategy.  In contrast, the others have it, e.g.: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L500 .

Allo.fundPool calls _transferAmountFrom: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L516 . Tracing the definitions, it invokes the strategy with `call(gas(), to, amount, gas(), 0x00, gas(), 0x00)` (in SafeTransferLib). I.e.: it invokes it with empty calldata, and will therefore try to call receive() and  revert.

## Recommendation


Add a receive() method.
