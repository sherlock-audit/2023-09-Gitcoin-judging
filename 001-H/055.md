# Anyone can call RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive
Anyone can call RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive. This allows attacker to break normal work of contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
`RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive` is important function. It can control when other function can be called. For example `withdraw` can be called only [when pool is inactive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L295C77-L295C94).

But `RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive` [can be called by anyone](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219-L222).
This will fully break contract logic as attacker will be able to change it any time.

Another usage of this will be when distribute for milestone will be called to frontrun it to set pool to active, then change recipient bid to bigger amount, then again set pool to inactive and receive bigger payment.
## Impact
Contract will not work normally.
