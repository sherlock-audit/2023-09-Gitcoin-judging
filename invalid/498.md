# Missing Parameter Existence Checks in Multiple Functions
## Summary

This report highlights a set of informational and low-severity issues found in several functions within the scope. These issues pertain to the absence of checks to ensure that new parameter values differ from existing ones, potentially leading to unnecessary state changes and event emissions. While each issue individually holds low severity, they have been combined into a single medium report due to their cumulative effect.

## Vulnerability Detail

The following functions lack checks to verify whether the new parameter values provided are identical to the current ones:

`Allo.sol`

1. `addToCloneableStrategies`
2. `removeFromCloneableStrategies`
3. `addPoolManager`
4. `removePoolManager`
5. `_updateRegistry`
6. `_updateTreasury`
7. `_updatePercentFee`
8. `_updateBaseFee`

`Registry.sol`

9. `updateProfilePendingOwner`

`QVSimpleStrategy.sol`

10. `addAllocator`
11.  `removeAllocator`

In these functions, if the new value is the same as the existing one, the functions will still execute the operation and emit an event, resulting in unnecessary state changes.

## Impact

They may lead to inefficient use of resources, including unnecessary transactions and event emissions. Additionally, the lack of parameter value change checks might result in misleading event emissions when there is no actual change in the state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add checks at the beginning of each affected function to ensure that the new parameter values differ from the current ones or to check for existence when adding and not existence when removing.
