# Replay attack possibility
Replay attack possibility
## Vulnerability Detail
When using createProfile() to create a new profile, the generation of an anchor contract involves calling _generateAnchor(). The salt value for _generateAnchor() is generated solely from _profileId and _name.
## Impact
A malicious user can generate the same salt by using the same profileId and name, resulting in the generation and deployment of the same anchor contract.

## Recommendation
Consider including msg.sender and nonce when calculating the salt value.
