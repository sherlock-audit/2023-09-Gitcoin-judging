# Not possible to register recipients when using registry anchor in RFP Strategies
## Summary
Not possible to register recipients when using registry anchor in RFP Strategies since the transaction will always revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
When using _registerRecipient()_ the variable _recipientAddress_ will only be set if _useRegistryAnchor_ is false. This means, that if we want to use a registry anchor in our strategy, we will always get the transaction reverted with _RECIPIENT_ERROR_ when trying to register a recipient. Here is a PoC:

    function test_registerRecipientNotWorkingWhenUsingRegistryAnchor() public {
        RFPSimpleStrategy strategyUsingRegistryAnchor;
        strategyUsingRegistryAnchor = new RFPSimpleStrategy(address(allo()), "RFPSimpleStrategyUsingRegistryAnchor");

        vm.prank(pool_admin());
        poolId = allo().createPoolWithCustomStrategy(
            poolProfile_id(),
            address(strategyUsingRegistryAnchor),
            abi.encode(maxBid, true, metadataRequired), // We want to use registry anchor
            NATIVE,
            0,
            poolMetadata,
            pool_managers()
        );

        address sender = recipient();
        bytes32 poolProfileId = registry().createProfile(
                                    0, "Pool Profile for test", Metadata({protocol: 1, pointer: "PoolProfile for test"}), sender, pool_managers()
                                );
        address poolProfileAnchor = registry().getProfileById(poolProfileId).anchor;

        Metadata memory metadata = Metadata({protocol: 1, pointer: "metadata"});
        address anchor = poolProfileAnchor;

        bytes memory data = abi.encode(anchor, 1e18, metadata); // We don't encode "recipientAddress" since we are using registry anchor

        // Recipient ID must be an Anchor
        vm.prank(address(allo()));
        address recipientId = strategyUsingRegistryAnchor.registerRecipient(data, sender); // This fails because recipientAddress is not set
    }

Output:
[FAIL. Reason: RECIPIENT_ERROR(0xE4b1D7ae386E2D5C25B5FCC960cFCC7293B3B985)] test_registerRecipientNotWorkingWhenUsingRegistryAnchor()
## Impact
RFP Strategies that are deployed with _useRegistryAnchor == true_ will be unusable, since no recipients will be able to be registered. This will cause a lose of funds from the users that created pools with these strategies, paying the fees and gas costs of deploying them.

## Tool used

Manual Review and Foundry

## Recommendation
We should also encode _recipientAddress_ into the _data_ even if _useRegistryAnchor_ is true.
