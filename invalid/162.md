# M-2: The funded amount is all gone to the treasury when the percentFee is 100%
when the ``percentFee `` is set to 100% which is not applicable when the user intention is to fund the pool but user instead finds  all the token is sent  to the treasury.
## Vulnerability Detail
POC 
-bob wants to fund a pool , 
-bob doesn't know that the ``percentFee``is set to 100% ,
-bob calls the function set  his intended pool and  amount to 100 DAI,
-then bob see that his 100 DAI is sent to the treasury instead of the pool .
```solidity
 function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```

## Impact
A user having clear  intention to fund the  pool but instead  it's  sent to the treasury.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The 100%  fee shouldn't be used for  ``percentFee`` . It should be ``(_percentFee <= 1e17) ``  if a user clearly wants to fund the pool 
```solidity
  /// @dev How the percentage is represented in our contracts: 1e18 = 100%, 1e17 = 10%, 1e16 = 1%, 1e15 = 0.1%
    uint256 private percentFee;
```
```solidity
    function _updatePercentFee(uint256 _percentFee) internal {
       -   if (_percentFee > 1e18) revert INVALID_FEE();
       +  if (_percentFee <= 1e17) revert INVALID_FEE();

       percentFee = _percentFee;

        emit PercentFeeUpdated(percentFee);
    }
```
