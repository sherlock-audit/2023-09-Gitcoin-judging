# Pool manager can reallocate the accepted Recipient
## Summary
No check in `_allocate` function to verify is accepted recipient is already added. This allows a pool manager to reallocation of `acceptedRecipientId`

## Vulnerability Detail
In `RFPSimpleStrategy` contract, `_allocate` function doesnâ€™t check if `acceptedRecipientId` is already set.
A non trusted pool manager can just set `poolActive` to true and reallocate a new `acceptedRecipientId`.

## Impact
Allows reallocation of accepted Recipient at any point of time

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```js
if (acceptedRecipientId != address(0)) {
    revert RECIPIENT_ALREADY_ACCEPTED();
}
```
