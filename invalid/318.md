# Updating the treasury could accidentally lock genuine funds
Updating the treasury address could potentially lock funds if not done carefully
## Vulnerability Detail
The key parts of the Allo contract related to this are:
1. The treasury variable stores the treasury address: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L60)
2. The _updateTreasury internal function updates this variable: [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L564-L567 )
3. The _fundPool internal function sends fees to the treasury address: [Link 3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L513)
So if _updateTreasury is called to change the treasury, any funds that were sent to the old treasury address would be locked there, with no way to recover them.
For example:
A. Treasury address is set to 0x1234
B. _fundPool sends 100 DAI fees to 0x1234
C. _updateTreasury is called, changing treasury to 0x5678
D. The 100 DAI at 0x1234 is now locked
This could happen by mistake if the treasury address is changed without coordinating to drain the old treasury address first.

## Impact
- Loss of legitimate funds sent to old treasury
- No way to recover them if Treasury A private key is lost

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
- Store fee balances per treasury address
- When changing treasury, withdraw any existing fee balance to the owner address
- Only set new treasury after existing balance is drained
