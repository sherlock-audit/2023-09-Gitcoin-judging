# Corruptible upgradability pattern in Strategies due to inheriting from contracts that contain storage and no gap
Strategies inherits from contracts  that are not stateless and that don't contain storage gaps  can be dangerous when upgrading.
## Vulnerability Detail

When creating upgradable contracts that inherit from other contracts is important that there are storage gap in case storage variable are added to inherited contracts.If an inherited contract is a stateless contract (it doesn't have any storage) then it is acceptable to omit a storage gap, since these function similar to libraries and aren't intended to add any storage. The issue is that `strategies` inherit from `BaseStratergy`contract  that contains storage that don't contain any gaps . This  can pose a significant risk when updating a contracts because they can shift the storage slots of all inherited contracts.

## Impact

corruption of storage slots during an upgrade

## Tool used

## Recommendation

Add storage gaps to all inherited contracts that contain storage variables.
