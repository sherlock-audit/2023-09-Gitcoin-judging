# Missing adjustments on `allocator.voiceCredits` allows bypassing `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`
Allocators can allocate voice credits indefinitely affecting votes and payouts within a strategy.

## Vulnerability Detail
Allocators are assigned to allocate voice credits to recipients, each allocator can allocate upto `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`.
This can be tracked by `_hasVoiceCreditsLeft`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L144  
```solidity
    /// @notice Checks if the allocator has voice credits left
    /// @param _voiceCreditsToAllocate The voice credits to allocate
    /// @param _allocatedVoiceCredits The allocated voice credits
    /// @return true if the allocator has voice credits left
function _hasVoiceCreditsLeft(uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate, uint256 _allocatedVoiceCredits)
        internal
        view
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        return _voiceCreditsToAllocate + _allocatedVoiceCredits <= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator;
    }
```
The issue is that after an allocator allocates credit to a recipient `allocator.voiceCredits` is never updated to account for these credits which means an allocator can allocate credits indefinitely bypassing `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L107
```solidity
function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal virtual override {
        (address recipientId, uint256 voiceCreditsToAllocate) = abi.decode(_data, (address, uint256));

        // spin up the structs in storage for updating
        Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
        Allocator storage allocator = allocators[_sender];

        // check that the sender can allocate votes
        if (!_isValidAllocator(_sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();

        // check that the recipient is accepted
        if (!_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId)) revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);

        // check that the recipient has voice credits left to allocate
        if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();//@audit-info

        _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);//@audit-issue allocator.voiceCredits is never updated.
    }
```
You can see that `allocator.voiceCredits` is not updated within [_qv_allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L506). 
This is problematic since the number of credits or votes received by a recipient is used to determine the [payout](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L448) when distributing tokens to recipients, an allocator can essentially allocate a lot of credit to recipients(this could also be accounts controlled by the allocator).
Note: allocators are not trusted they can be added or removed by the pool managers.

## Impact
Allocators can bypass `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` which could drain the token distribution from a strategy.

## Recommendation
Update `allocator.voiceCredits` each time an allocator allocates credit to a recipient.
