# Possible Reentrancy attack
Possible Reentrancy attack

## Vulnerability Detail
It is possible to have a reentrancy attack in the `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` function because the `nonReentrant` modifier is missing.

When a user creates a pool with a custom strategy, he needs to call the `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` function. After that, in the `_createPool` function, the `initialize` function of the strategy is called:

```solidity
_strategy.initialize(poolId, _initStrategyData);
```

The strategy is expected to be custom and it is possible for a malicious user to perform a reentrancy attack in the `initialize` function. He can call `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` again and create as many pools as he want while paying the fee only once.

For example, he can create 10 custom strategies and 1 clonable strategy, paying the fee only once or he can introduce other unwanted behaviors.

## Impact
Lossing of money.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L453

```solidity
_strategy.initialize(poolId, _initStrategyData);
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `nonReentrant` modifier into `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` function simlar as `createPool` function.
