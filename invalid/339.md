# Just checking the code size of the preCalculatedAddress does not guarantee that it contains a valid Anchor contract
The preCalculatedAddress could already contain a malicious contract instead of a valid Anchor contract. Just checking the code size doesn't guarantee it is safe to use. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The key parts of the _generateAnchor() function relating to this are: [Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L338-L344)
It first calculates the predicted anchor address using CREATE3.getDeployed().
Then it checks if a contract already exists at that address by checking the code size.
If code exists, it assumes this is a valid Anchor by simply checking profileId matches.
But this doesn't guarantee safety or validity of the contract!
A malicious actor could:
1. Predict the anchor address for a profileId
2. Deploy a malicious contract to that address
3. When _generateAnchor() is called, the code size check passes
4. The malicious contract can execute any logic, not just return the profileId
This bypasses the validity check since code size > 0.

So in summary, relying only on code size allows arbitrary contract logic to bypass the validity checks.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The, _generateAnchor() should:
• Validate Anchor code matches expected ABI
• Check for expected functions and modifiers
• Deploy new Anchor if validation fails
• Emit events on deployment to detect malicious attempts
