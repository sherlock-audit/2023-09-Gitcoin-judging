# Inconsistency in Access Control Importation in the Allo Smart Contract
The Allo and Registry smart contract incorporates mixed versions of libraries from OpenZeppelin, utilizing both `openzeppelin-contracts` and `openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable`. Notably, the contract is importing `AccessControl.sol` instead of `AccessControlUpgradeable.sol`, which may create compatibility and upgradability issues within the contract ecosystem.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20Upgradeable.sol";
import "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";
import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol";
```
As seen, the `AccessControl` contract is imported from `openzeppelin-contracts` which is a non-upgradeable library, while other contracts like `Initializable` and `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` are imported from `openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable`, which is an upgradeable library.

## Impact

1. Upgradability Issues: Using non-upgradable components alongside upgradable ones will cause future upgrades to malfunction or be limited in functionality.
2. Incompatibility Issues: The simultaneous use of different versions of libraries might lead to conflicts in function calls or data handling, potentially causing unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Updating the import statement to `import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol";` for `allo.sol` and `Registry.sol` would align with this without forgetting to use ` __AccessControl_init` in the initializer.
