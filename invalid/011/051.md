# RFPSimpleStrategy doesn't have ability to witdraw contract's balance
## Summary
RFPSimpleStrategy doesn't have ability to witdraw contract's balance
## Vulnerability Detail
RFPSimpleStrategy can be created for different tokens. It's possible that it will be created for non native token. But contract also has ability to [top up it with native token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L500).

In this case it will [not possible to withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L300) as it uses pool token. So owner wil not be able to recover those funds.
## Impact
Funds will stick in contract.
