# No check for address(0) on allowedTokens in VotingMerkleStrategy could result in undesired behaviour
In `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy` in the initialization we should provide tokens allowed for voting. If none are provided, it is assumed that all tokens are accepted. But what if allowed tokens are provided and unintentially of is set to be the address(0). This will in having voting strategy with all allowed tokens, because marking `address(0) = true` in the map of the allowed tokens means all tokens are allowed.
## Vulnerability Detail
Here are code snippets showing how such user mistake could lead to unintended behaviour - having unlimeted options of voting tokens.
- Imagine one of the tokens in the provided array is address(0)
```solidity
        if (allowedTokensLength == 0) {
            // all tokens
            allowedTokens[address(0)] = true;
        }

        // Loop through the allowed tokens and set them to true
        for (uint256 i; i < allowedTokensLength;) {
            // @audit if inside allowedTokensArray there is a zero address, it will be interpreted as all tokens
            allowedTokens[_initializeData.allowedTokens[i]] = true;
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
```
Here we can see that if we set `allowedTokens[address(0)] = true`, this will result in passing checks for allowed tokens, which consist in:
```solidity
   // The token must be in the allowed token list and not be native token or zero address
        if (!allowedTokens[token] && !allowedTokens[address(0)]) {
            revert INVALID();
        }
```
I.e we will never revert.
## Impact
- Unintended behaviour 
- Possibility to allocate tokens using potentially malicious ERC20

## Recommendation
Check for `address(0)` and revert if it is passed
```solidity
        // Loop through the allowed tokens and set them to true
        for (uint256 i; i < allowedTokensLength;) {
				if(_initializeData.allowedTokens[i] == address(0)){
				revert("ZERO_ADDRESS");
				}
            allowedTokens[_initializeData.allowedTokens[i]] = true;
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
```
