# Wrong accounting of `voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` in QVBaseStrategy

In the function [`_qv_allocate()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L506) of the QVBaseStrategy contract, the accounting is wrong which result in more votes received for a recipient if the allocator votes multiple times for him.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function [`_qv_allocate()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L506) allows to compute and store the votes and credits used by allocators on a given recipient.

It first query the previous votes and credits casted on the recipient and then compute the new values.

But when storing the new credits used on the recipient by the allocator, it adds the total used (previous + new credits) to the previous value instead of assigning it. 
This results in the storage variable `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` to increase more than it should as after each iteration it's new value is `creditsCastToRecipient + totalCredits` instead of `totalCredits`.

Thus on the next iteration the votes computed will be higher and the `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` will keep increasing.

Casting multiple times a low amount of credits will result in higher vote value for a recipient than a one time casting.

## Impact

High. Wrong accounting of votes, casting small amounts multiple time results in more votes than it should.

## Code Snippet

[Code error snippet.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L529)

```solidity
_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
```

Here is a poc that can be copy pasted in QVSimpleStrategy.t.sol

```solidity
function test_allocate_wrong_accounting() public {
        //get recipient and allocator
        address recipientId = __register_accept_recipient();
        address allocator = randomAddress();

        //add allocator
        vm.prank(pool_manager2());
        qvSimpleStrategy().addAllocator(allocator);
        vm.warp(allocationStartTime + 10);

        //max vote is 100, we are going to vote 10
        bytes memory allocateData = __generateAllocation(recipientId, 10);

        //vote 10 multiple times (3 times) so we cast 30 votes total
        vm.startPrank(address(allo()));
        qvSimpleStrategy().allocate(allocateData, allocator);
        qvSimpleStrategy().allocate(allocateData, allocator);
        qvSimpleStrategy().allocate(allocateData, allocator);

        //query total vote stored
        QVSimpleStrategy.Recipient memory _recipient = qvSimpleStrategy().getRecipient(recipientId);
        uint totalVote = _recipient.totalVotesReceived;

        //compute real total vote value
        uint realTotalVote = _sqrt(30 * 1e18);

        //compute what the contract computed, we have 40 credits of voting power instead of 30
        uint wrongAccounting = _sqrt(40 * 1e18);

        //real vote power of 30 credits is less then what is stored
        assertLt(realTotalVote, totalVote);
        assertEq(wrongAccounting, totalVote);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `=` instead of `+=` when storing the `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` value.
