# setPoolActive in RFPSimpleStartegy is callable by non pool managers

The function setPoolActive in RFPSimpleStartegy.sol is missing the modifier "onlyPoolManager". The internal function _setPoolActive which is called by setPoolActive also lacks verification.
This is clearly unintentional since the documentation states that msg.sender must be a pool manager.

## Vulnerability Detail

An unauthorized contract can call the function setPoolActive in RFPSimpleStartegy.sol, and set the poolActive flag. 

## Impact

In general, the vulnerability allows an attacker to change the state of the pool without the manager's permission and without them knowing. This could result in a denial of service of the pool.

### Example

An attacker could activate the pool in the waiting state between the allocate and distribute functions by the pool manager. This would make the manager unware to the current pool state and they wouldn't be able to distribute the money to the recipient.
