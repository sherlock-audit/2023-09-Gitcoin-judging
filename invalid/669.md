# Wrong implementation of `NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS` check in `_distribute()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Since each time it checks if the initial winning bid amount `proposalBid` is greater than `poolAmount`, even if it's not the first distribution.

The check will most certainly revert if it's not the first time to distribute, as the achieved portion of the `milestone` makes `poolAmount < proposalBid`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change to:

```solidity
// make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the distribution amount
if (amount > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
```
