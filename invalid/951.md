# Admin can assign manager roles to invalid addresses
## Summary
Admin can mistakenly assign manager roles to an extruder who is not a member of a profile in the -addPoolManager
## Vulnerability Detail
During role assignment by the admin using the 'FunctionaddPoolManager'.   isOwnerOrMemberOfProfile function" from the registry contract is not used to crosscheck if new manager is valid before assigning manager roles to them. Thereby allowing extruder addresses to gain managerial roles and manipulate contract by causing denial of service attacks to recipients and causing managerial errors detrimental to normal functioning of the contract.

`
  function addPoolManager(
        uint256 _poolId,
        address _manager
    ) external onlyPoolAdmin(_poolId) {
        // Reverts if the address is the zero address with 'ZERO_ADDRESS()'
        if (_manager == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

        // Grants the pool manager role to the '_manager' address
        _grantRole(pools[_poolId].managerRole, _manager);
    }
