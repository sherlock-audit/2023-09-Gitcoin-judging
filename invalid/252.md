# Registry.sol contracts does not receive funds as expected
## Summary
The Registry.sol contract has the function of recovering the funds in the contract called  `recoverFunds()`, but it does not have any function that allows receiving native token.

## Vulnerability Detail

As mentioned in the docs and the comment in the code, Registry.sol has to receive funds, but this cannot happen.
If we look for any payable or fallback functio, it is not declared.

Therefore, the contract does not have the ability to receive native tokens.

Try sending ether to the contract:

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.19;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {Registry} from "../../../contracts/core/Registry.sol";

contract RegistryTest is Test {
    Registry public registry;

    address payable bob = payable(makeAddr("bob"));
    address payable alice = payable(makeAddr("alice"));

    function setUp() public {
        registry = new Registry();
        registry.initialize(msg.sender);
    }

  function test_notAllowedFunds() public {
        (bool success, ) = address(registry).call{value: 1 ether}("");
        assertTrue(!success);
    }
}
```
The transaction will fail.

If you look at the contract, there is no function that can receive a native token. However, the protocol attempted to implement a unit test to receive the funds, the test passed but was not correctly implemented.

This [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/test/foundry/core/Registry.t.sol#L404-417) snippet is out of scope:

```solidity
    function test_recoverFunds() public {
        address user = makeAddr("recipient");

        vm.deal(address(registry()), 1e18);

        assertEq(address(registry()).balance, 1e18);
        assertEq(user.balance, 0);

        vm.prank(registry_owner());
        registry().recoverFunds(NATIVE, user);

        assertEq(address(registry()).balance, 0);
        assertNotEq(user.balance, 0);
    }
```
The test does not use the functions to transfer ether, but rather uses vm.deal, which only gives the balance the address of the contract and gives you a balance.

While this [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/test/foundry/core/Registry.t.sol#L404-417) is out of scope, it is useful to show that the protocol expects this to work fine.


## Impact
It cannot be used to receive funds and execute transactions on behalf of the profile and transfers any native token in the balance in Allo to the recipient.

## Tool used

* Manual Review
* Foundry

## Recommendation
Add fallback function like the `receive()` function that can be allow receive fund of the native toen, how the protocol is applied in the Anchor.sol contract:

```solidity
Anchor.sol: 58 receive() external payable {}
```
