# Missing Access Control in setPoolActive Function and its Internal Implementation
## Summary

The **setPoolActive** function, which allows toggling the status of a pool between active and inactive, lacks an appropriate access control modifier. This omission is also observed in its internal implementation, **_setPoolActive**.

## Vulnerability Detail

Both the **setPoolActive** function and its internal counterpart **_setPoolActive** lack access control modifiers, allowing any external entity to change the pool's active status. Such a critical function, especially one related to toggling the active state of a pool, should have proper restrictions to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Impact

Without access control, malicious or unintended actors can exploit this vulnerability to toggle the pool's status, potentially disrupting normal operations, causing unexpected behaviors, or leading to a denial of service where users cannot interact with the pool as expected. This poses not only a functional risk but also undermines trust in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement an access control modifier such as **onlyPoolManager** (if only a designated pool manager should be able to change the status) or another appropriate modifier based on your system's design. Apply this modifier to **setPoolActive** function.
