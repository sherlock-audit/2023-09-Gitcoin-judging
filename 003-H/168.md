# In QV strategy, allocators by default get infinite votes
## Summary

The variable `allocator.voiceCredits` tracking how many voice credits an allocator has already spent is never updated. This allows allocators to get infinite votes, letting the last mover send 100% of the pool to the recipient of their choice.

This is separate from another bug where an incorrect formula allows allocators exponentially-but-not-infinitely many votes. If this bug is fixed, the other one will still be there, and vice versa.

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary.

Note that, once a pool is funded, there is no way to withdraw the funds other than by  distributing it to the winners.

## Impact

The QV voting mechanism becomes meaningless; the last mover gets 100%

## Code Snippet

See the lack of update to `allocator.voiceCredits`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L529

See how the check for whether an allocator can allocate votes is `voiceCreditsToAllocate + allocator.voiceCredits <= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`, meaning that allocate() can be called repeatedly with `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` each time.
