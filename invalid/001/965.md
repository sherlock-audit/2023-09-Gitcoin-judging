# Users can bypass the required fees during pool funding even in cloneable strategies
## Summary
Users can bypass the required fees during pool funding even in cloneable strategies. Also when the pool is funded directly the `pool Amount` is not increased.

## Vulnerability Detail 
Users can directly transfer using ERC20 tokens or directly transfer NATIVE currency using `selfdestruct` to the strategy. This would result in users funding pools without paying any fees to the treasury.

## Impact
Stuck of funds in the protocol, because the `poolAmount` is not increased during direct transfer leading to not properly distribution process.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Implement logic to stop direct transfers or if you keeps the allowance of direct transfers implement logic that increase the `poolAmount` when direct transfer is done.
