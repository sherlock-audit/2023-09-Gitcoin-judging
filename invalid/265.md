# For upgrading contracts, implementation contracts not been initialized
## Summary
For upgrading contracts, implementation contracts not been initialized

## Vulnerability Detail
An uninitialized implementation contract can be initialized by an attacker, and the attacker gets the owner , which may impact the proxy.


## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add _disableInitializers() each upgradable contracts:

```solidity
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow 
constructor constructor() { 
     _disableInitializers(); 
}
