# Maintain before balance and after balance while dealing fee-on transfer tokens
## Summary
[_fundPool()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L502) function deducts the fee and transfer the amount to the distribution strategy but if user try to use tokens which have on-fee tokens means it deducts fee on each transfer and transferFrom then amount receives less than mentioned .

## Vulnerability Detail
If Alice try to fundPool using deflationary/transfer-on fee tokens call [_fundPool()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L502) function with amount 100 but it deducts some percentage on each transfer and transferFrom Allo.sol contract receives only 99 tokens. Even amount fee which is deducted and [transferAmountFrom()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L513) by user to Allo.sol contract also received less than feeAmount  .

## Impact
A transfer-on-fee token or a deflationary/rebasing token, causing the received amount to be less than the accounted amount. For instance, a deflationary tokens might charge a certain fee for every transfer() or transferFrom().

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maintain before and after balance while dealing with transfer-on fee tokens..
Before increasePoolAmount() maintain before and after amount in-order accounting amount received after fee-on transfer.
code can be changed like below 
```solidity
            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

uint amountBefore = address(this).balance;//@audit changed here
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
uint amountAfter = address(this).balance;//@audit changed here
uint ActualAmountRecevied = amountAfter - amountBefore;//@audit changed here
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(ActualAmountRecevied);//@audit changed here
```
Please look into `//@audit changed here` comment above code snippet .
