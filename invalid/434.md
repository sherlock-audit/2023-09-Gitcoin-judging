# _registerRecipient() - anyone can register as a recipient even if he's not a profile member
## Summary
In DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol,  RFPSimpleStrategy.sol, and QVBaseStrategy.sol, `_registerRecipient()` is used to Submit recipient to pool and set their status, submit a proposal to RFP pool, or submit application to pool, depending on the strategy.

The `_registerRecipient()` should be available only to profile members but the check implemented currently is not sufficient and anyone can register as a recipient.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take a look at the `_registerRecipient` function in the DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy contract:
```solidity
 /// @notice Submit recipient to pool and set their status.
    /// @param _data The data to be decoded.
    /// @custom:data if 'useRegistryAnchor' is 'true' (address recipientId, address recipientAddress, Metadata metadata)
    /// @custom:data if 'useRegistryAnchor' is 'false' (address recipientAddress, address registryAnchor, Metadata metadata)
    /// @param _sender The sender of the transaction
    /// @return recipientId The ID of the recipient
    function _registerRecipient(bytes memory _data, address _sender)
        internal
        override
        onlyActiveRegistration
        returns (address recipientId)
    {
        bool isUsingRegistryAnchor;
        address recipientAddress;
        address registryAnchor;
        Metadata memory metadata;

        // decode data custom to this strategy
        if (useRegistryAnchor) {
            (recipientId, recipientAddress, metadata) = abi.decode(_data, (address, address, Metadata));

            // If the sender is not a profile member this will revert
            if (!_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) {
                revert UNAUTHORIZED();
            }
        } else {
            (recipientAddress, registryAnchor, metadata) = abi.decode(_data, (address, address, Metadata));

            // Set this to 'true' if the registry anchor is not the zero address
            isUsingRegistryAnchor = registryAnchor != address(0);

            // If using the 'registryAnchor' we set the 'recipientId' to the 'registryAnchor', otherwise we set it to the 'msg.sender'
            recipientId = isUsingRegistryAnchor ? registryAnchor : _sender;

            // Checks if the '_sender' is a member of the profile 'anchor' being used and reverts if not
            if (isUsingRegistryAnchor && !_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) {
                revert UNAUTHORIZED();
            }
        }
///more unrelated functionality below
}
```
If `useRegistryAnchor` is currently set as `false` then we'll enter the else statement and will decode the data we provided in the 1st place. 
In the data, we'd have provided `registryAnchor` to be the 0 address so this equals 0:
```solidity
            // Set this to 'true' if the registry anchor is not the zero address
            isUsingRegistryAnchor = registryAnchor != address(0);
```
then the check that check if the `_sender` is a member of the profile becomes useless as we'll never enter the if:
```solidity
            // Checks if the '_sender' is a member of the profile 'anchor' being used and reverts if not
            if (isUsingRegistryAnchor && !_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) {
                revert UNAUTHORIZED();
            }
```
As a result, anyone can register as a recipient. 
## Impact
Anyone can register as a recipient, even though it is supposed to be available only for profile members.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the `isUsingRegistryAnchor`:
```solidity
if(!_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) {
                revert UNAUTHORIZED();
            }
```
