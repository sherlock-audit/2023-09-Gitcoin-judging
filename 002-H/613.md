# Anyone can call ` RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive` because of a missing modifier
## Summary

Anyone can set the pool to active or inactive and thereby grief a recipient for his payout


## Vulnerability Detail

In the `RFPSimpleStrategy`  the function `setPoolActive()` can change the state of the pool from active to inactive and vice versa. According to the notes this function should only be callable by a poolManager but it does not have the corresponding modifier so it can be called by anyone. Since particular functions can only be called when the pool is active or inactive, bad user can switch the status to mess with the pool. For example the function `distribute` can only be called when the pool is active. Since only one recipient can benefit from the pool, a recipient that was not chosen could set the pool to active every time the poolManager wants to distribute funds and thereby prevent the chosen recipient from getting his payout. This is especially feasible on L2 where the transaction cost are very low.

## Impact

Anyone can change the active status of the pool and mess with the pool flow
