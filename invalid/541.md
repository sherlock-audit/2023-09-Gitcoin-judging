# QV Strategy has no receive() function
The QV strategy Base and Simple contracts don't implement a `receive()` function
## Vulnerability Detail
When creating a pool   `_fundPool()` is invoked to credit the percent fee to Allo and to credit the remaining funds to the underlying strategy. The issue is that `QVBaseStrategy` & `QVSimpleStrategy` don't implement a `receive()` function and therefore these strategies become unusable with the `Native` token ( for example `RFPSimpleStrategy` does implement a receive() ).
```solidity
function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        // code ... 
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```
## Impact
QV strategy is nonfunctional with `Native` token
