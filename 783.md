# If the registration period and allocation period are overlapped in QVBaseStrategy, allocation values for recipients can be decreased and some funds will never be distributed.
## Summary
As we can see from the function `_updatePoolTimestamps` of `QVBaseStrategy`, the registration period and allocation period can be overlapped.
If a recipient with non-zero allocation value is removed in this overlapped period, the `totalRecipientVotes` will not be decreased.
As a result, some funds of `poolAmount` will not be distributed to anyone.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
        // validate the timestamps for this strategy
        if (
            block.timestamp > _registrationStartTime || _registrationStartTime > _registrationEndTime
                || _registrationStartTime > _allocationStartTime || _allocationStartTime > _allocationEndTime
                || _registrationEndTime > _allocationEndTime
        ) {
            revert INVALID();
        }

```
As you can see from the above code `_registrationEndTime` can be over the value `_allocationStartTime`.
Suppose a allocator already allocated some values to an recipient with `Accepted` status. Then the allocated values are added to the `totalRecipientVotes`.
Next, suppose that the recipient are removed. For example the recipient calls the function `_registerRecipient` with changed `recipientAddress` value, then status of the recipient will be changed from `Accepted` to `Pending`.
Next, the allocation period are closed and funds are distributed.
Then the allocation value for that recipient never be distributed and thus the allocation values for other recipients will be decresed.

## Impact
Allocation can be set invalid. As a result funds can be distributed incorrectly and some funds never be distributed and remained to strategy contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The registration period should not be overlapped with allocation period.
If the overlap of two periods are required essentially, when status of a recipient changes to `pending` from `accepted`, the allocaion value for the recipient should be removed from `totalRecipientVotes`.
