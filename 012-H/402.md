# Check in `_distribute()` might revert even tho there is enough funds to pay
## Summary

In the function [`_distribute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L432) there is a wrong check that requires the whole `proposalBid` to be higher than `poolAmount` while it should apply the milestone percentage first otherwise if we already paid some milestone the `poolAmount` might be smaller and thus revert even tho we had enough to pay the milestone.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the function [`_distribute()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L432) of the RFPSimpleStrategy there is a check to make sure the `poolAmount` is enough to pay the milestone by checking it against `proposalBid`.

But the variable `proposalBid` represents the whole payout for the RFP that is then divided in multiple milestones.

When distributing we distribute for a given milestone that is a percentage of the `proposalBid` with the total of all milestones being 100%. This means that we should be applying the milestone percentage to the `proposalBid` before checking it against the `poolAmount`. Otherwise if we already distributed some milestone we might revert as the `poolAmount` could be smaller than `proposalBid` even tho we have enough funds to pay.

## Impact

Medium. To call `distribute()` the `poolAmount` will have to always be higher than `proposalBid` requiring the pool manager to leave more funds than needed on the strategy.

## Code Snippet

[Error snippet.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L432)

```solidity
if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
```

Poc that can be copy pasted in RFPSimpleStrategy.t.sol.

```solidity
function test_distribute_revert_poolAmount() public {
        //this will set 2 milestone: 70% for the first one and 30% for the second one
        //proposal bid is 1e18
        address recipientId = __register_setMilestones_allocate_submitUpcomingMilestone();

        //fund the pool
        uint amount = 1e18 + 1e17; //add 1e17 to pay the percentage fee and have a little more
        vm.deal(pool_admin(), amount);
        vm.prank(pool_admin());
        allo().fundPool{value: amount}(poolId, amount);

        //first distribute work as expected
        vm.prank(address(allo()));
        strategy.distribute(new address[](0), "", pool_admin());

        //submit second milestone
        vm.prank(recipient());
        strategy.submitUpcomingMilestone(Metadata({protocol: 1, pointer: "metadata"}));

        //second distribute doesn't work even tho we have 30% of 1e18 available
        assertLt(1e18 * 3e17 / 1e18, address(strategy).balance);
        vm.prank(address(allo()));
        vm.expectRevert(NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS.selector);
        strategy.distribute(new address[](0), "", pool_admin());
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Apply the `milestone.amountPercentage` to the `proposalBid` like done to calculate `amount` before checking it against `poolAmount`.
