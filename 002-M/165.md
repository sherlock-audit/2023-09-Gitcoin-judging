# Fee on Transfer tokens are incorrectly accounted in `_fundPool`
## Summary
Incorrect accounting for FoT tokens in `_fundPool`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Protocols supports all kinds of tokens
> Do you expect to use any of the following tokens with non-standard behaviour with the smart contracts?
Yes as we support all ERC20 tokens.

>Are there any FEE-ON-TRANSFER tokens interacting with the smart contracts?
Yes. When funding a pool on Allo.sol

But when funding pool `FEE-ON-TRANSFER`  tokens are not considered, protocol only deducts their fee and transfers the amount to the distribution strategy but FoT tokens subtracts fee while transferring the token.
```solidity
function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);//@audit amountAfterFee could be overstated for FoT tokens and would cause reverts in most cases.

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```
As a result fee charged on transfers by specified token are not considered and `poolAmount` would be overstated an results to wrong accounting within the pool.

## Impact
[`poolAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L155) would be overstated for FoT tokens and would result to incorrect internal accounting.
