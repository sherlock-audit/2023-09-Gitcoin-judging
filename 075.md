# User can redeploy a malicious strategy with create2 after the original strategy was approved/cloneable
## Summary
User can create a malicious strategy with create2 after it was approved/cloneable
## Vulnerability Detail
After a user creates seemingly harmless strategy (using CREATE2), the owner likes it and makes it clonable/approved. After the strategy has been cloned enough times, the user selfdestructs the contract with the strategy and using CREATE2 deploys a malicious strategy at the same address the owner has approved.

Example:
DeployerDeployer -- create2 -> Deployer -- create --> Strategy
After it was approved the attacker selfdestructs both the current Deployer and Strategy contracts and deploys the same Deployer and different strategy at the same address:
DeployerDeployer -- create2 -> Deployer -- create --> Malicious strategy

The address when using 'create' is the same because it compiles the following way:
last 20 bytes of sha3(rlp(sender addr, nonce))
The sender (Deployer contract) is always with the same address as it is being deployed with create2
The nonce is the number of transactions of sender (Deployer contract)
When we first deploy the strategy contract using create the nonce of the deployer contract is e.g 0. (So address is the same and the nonce is 0)
In order to get the nonce to 0 again (to successfully deploy the contract at the same address) the attacker deletes the deployer contract, resetting its nonce to 0 when redeployed.
So in the end the nonce is 0, (as used in deploying the proposal strategy) and the deployer contract address is the same, which compiles in the same address of the proposal strategy but with different code.
