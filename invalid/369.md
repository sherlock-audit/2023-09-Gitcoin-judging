# DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy recipients can change recipientAddress and metadata after being allocated to
## Summary

Lack of validation allows users to change their recipient data after being allocated to, effectively changing what an allocator has funded while maintaining the ability for the recipient to claim their allocation even though they're no longer accepted.

## Vulnerability Detail

It's only possible to allocate to a recipient if they have been accepted. It's possible however for a recipient to re-register after being allocated to. This is possible because timestamp validation logic doesn't validate that there is no overlap between the registration and allocation periods, i.e. it doesn't enforce that registration end time is less than allocation start time. It's also not required for a recipient to be accepted to claim an allocation. As a result, a recipient can re-register after being allocated to change their metadata or recipient address to values that the allocator did not expect and may not support, while still being able to claim that allocation and connecting that allocator to their new registration status.

Consider an example in which an allocator is allocated to a recipient whose `recipientAddress` is an immutable smart contract in which the allocator can be certain as to how the funds will be used. If the recipient can simply change the `recipientAddress` after being allocated, then they can trick allocators and run away with the tokens.

Consider another example in which an allocator allocates to a recipient for a good cause as is included in the metadata. The recipient could simply change the metadata after allocation to some terrible thing that the allocator would not like to be associated with.

## Impact

Recipients can change what allocators had allocated to after they have already allocated those funds.

```solidity
// @audit doesn't enforce that registrationEndTime < allocationStartTime
function _isPoolTimestampValid(
    uint64 _registrationStartTime,
    uint64 _registrationEndTime,
    uint64 _allocationStartTime,
    uint64 _allocationEndTime
) internal view {
    if (
        block.timestamp > _registrationStartTime || _registrationStartTime > _registrationEndTime
            || _registrationStartTime > _allocationStartTime || _allocationStartTime > _allocationEndTime
            || _registrationEndTime > _allocationEndTime
    ) {
        revert INVALID();
    }
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Timestamp validation logic should include a check to enforce that the registration and allocation periods do not have overlap.
