# The createPool function is vulnerable to a DOS attack.
## Summary

createPool checks if the strategy.poolId is valid. However, the strategy was created before poolId increased. 

## Vulnerability Detail
An attacker can call createPool before the user, and let the following line always revert.   
```Solidity
        if (_strategy.getPoolId() != poolId || address(_strategy.getAllo()) != address(this)) revert MISMATCH();
```

## Impact
Protocol can't function well

Bind the create strategy inside of createPool
