# The same Pool manager can `reviewRecipients()` multiple time in QVBaseStrategy contract
The same Pool manager can `reviewRecipients()` multiple time in QVBaseStrategy contract

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's suppose there're 3 manager with the threshold to review recipients is 2. It should be 2 or more different manager to review the recipient in order to get passed. But in the contract, 1 manager can just make 2 votes to 1 recipient to get passed. Even though manager is trusted, it makes no sense that it's doable for manager to make that happen.

```solidity
    function reviewRecipients(address[] calldata _recipientIds, Status[] calldata _recipientStatuses)
        external
        virtual
        onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)
        onlyActiveRegistration
    {
        // make sure the arrays are the same length
        uint256 recipientLength = _recipientIds.length;
        if (recipientLength != _recipientStatuses.length) revert INVALID();

        for (uint256 i; i < recipientLength;) {
            Status recipientStatus = _recipientStatuses[i];
            address recipientId = _recipientIds[i];

            if (recipientStatus == Status.None || recipientStatus == Status.Appealed) {
                revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
            }

            //<@@ NO CHECK IF THE MANAGER HAD VOTED TO THIS RECIPIENT BEFORE

            reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus]++; 
            if (reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus] >= reviewThreshold) {
                Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
                recipient.recipientStatus = recipientStatus;

                emit RecipientStatusUpdated(recipientId, recipientStatus, address(0));
            }

            emit Reviewed(recipientId, recipientStatus, msg.sender);

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```
## Impact
The recipient can be freely passed by only 1 manager which is not supposed to

## Recommendation
Add mapping to check if the manager had reviewed this recipient before
