# Implementation can be `initialized`
## Summary

The contracts are upgradable, inheriting from the Initializable contract. However, the current implementations are missing the `_disableInitializers()` function call in the `constructors`. Thus, an attacker can initialize the implementation. Usually, the initialized implementation has no direct impact on the proxy itself; however, it can be exploited in a phishing attack. In rare cases, the implementation might be mutable and may have an impact on the proxy.

## Vulnerability Detail

### OpenZepplin Recommendation

**Initializing the Implementation Contract**

> Do not leave an implementation contract uninitialized. An uninitialized implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the `_disableInitializers` function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:

```solidity
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/// @title Allo
/// @author @thelostone-mc <aditya@gitcoin.co>, @0xKurt <kurt@gitcoin.co>, @codenamejason <jason@gitcoin.co>, @0xZakk <zakk@gitcoin.co>, @nfrgosselin <nate@gitcoin.co>
/// @notice This contract is used to create & manage pools as well as manage the protocol.
/// @dev The contract must be initialized with the 'initialize()' function.
contract Allo is IAllo, Native, Transfer, Initializable, Ownable, AccessControl, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, Errors {
```

[Allo.sol - Line 38](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L38)

```solidity
/// @title Registry Contract
/// @author @thelostone-mc <aditya@gitcoin.co>, @0xKurt <kurt@gitcoin.co>, @codenamejason <jason@gitcoin.co>, @0xZakk <zakk@gitcoin.co>, @nfrgosselin <nate@gitcoin.co>
/// @notice Registry contract for creating and managing profiles
/// @dev This contract is used to create and manage profiles for the Allo protocol
///      It is also used to deploy the anchor contract for each profile which acts as a proxy
///      for the profile and is used to receive funds and execute transactions on behalf of the profile
///      The Registry is also used to add and remove members from a profile and update the profile 'Metadata'
contract Registry is IRegistry, Native, AccessControl, Transfer, Initializable, Errors {
```

[Registry.sol - Line 40](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L40)

As we can see here both `Allo` and `Registry` contracts are inheriting the `Initializer` contract but both contracts are missing the `disabled constructor`.

here I had confirmed the team about all ungradable contracts.

## Impact

An uninitialized implementation contract can be taken over by an attacker, which may impact the proxy.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Solodit

## Recommendation

It is recommended to call `_disableInitializers()` function within the contractâ€™s constructor to prevent the implementation from being initialized.

```solidity
/// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
}
```
