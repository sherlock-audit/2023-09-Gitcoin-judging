# Protocol isn't compatible with fee on transfer tokens
Protocol isn't compatible with fee on transfer tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
When user funds pool with fee on transfer tokens, then [strategy receives amount that user has sent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L516). In case of fee on transfer tokens, strategy will receive smaller amount than was sent. But then strategy [balance is increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L517) and strategy doesn't have ability to check if it's true, [it just believes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L155).
## Impact
Strategy `poolAmount` is not correct.
## Code Snippet
Provided above.
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In order to repair this Allo should calculate how many tokens was received by strategy.
