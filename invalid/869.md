# ETH transfers susceptible to gas griefing / DOS.

ETH transfers susceptible to gas griefing / DOS.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract uses the `safeTransferEth` function from the `SafeTransferLib` library to transfer ETH. As stated in the SafeTransferLib library itself, this function is susceptible to gas griefing / DOS.

```solidity
/// @dev Sends `amount` (in wei) ETH to `to`.
/// Reverts upon failure.
///
/// Note: This implementation does NOT protect against gas griefing.
/// Please use `forceSafeTransferETH` for gas griefing protection.
function safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 amount) internal
```

So if a pool operates with NATIVE tokens, and a recipient is set to receive tokens from this pool, they can run a very large pool in the receiving address contract's `receive` function to use up all the gas. This will lead to situations where payouts can be delayed or DOSd since admins/managers wont be able to send out funds to users in a for loop, like the ones used in the `_distribute` functions in multiple strategies.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the `forceSafeTransferETH` function on Solady's SafeTransfer library to protect against gas griefing. This function also takes in a `gasStipend` which limits gas griefing attacks.
