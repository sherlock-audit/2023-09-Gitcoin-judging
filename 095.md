# Malicious actor can DoS any pool using RFPSimpleStrategy or RFPCommitteeStrategy
## Summary
A vulnerability in the code allows malicious actor to DoS any pool that uses either `RFPSimpleStrategy` or `RFPCommitteeStrategy` and disrupt the following operations:

- Allocate & distribute funds
- Register recipients
- Withdrawals

## Vulnerability Detail
The following functions in `RFPSimpleStrategy` use modifiers that rely on `poolActive` being in a given state in order to allow their execution. Respectively:

| Function | Modifier |
|---|---|
| `_allocate()` | `onlyActivePool` |
| `_registerRecipient()` | `onlyActivePool` |
| `_distribute()` | `onlyInactivePool` |
| `withdraw()` | `onlyInactivePool` |

It seems though that the `setPoolActive()` function lacks access control and allows any external user to change the state of `poolActive`:

As evident by the function documentation, this is a mistake since the documentation states that the function must only be available to pool managers.

Pools that use `RFPCommitteeStrategy` are impacted as well since it extends from `RFPSimpleStrategy`.

## Impact

This vulnerability allows malicious actors to DoS and disrupt pools that use `RFPSimpleStrategy` or `RFPCommitteeStrategy`.

Although this is not necessary, if the attack is performed via front-running or sandwiching, its impact would be even more severe and exacerbated.  

## Code Snippet

Missing access control modifier:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` modifier to the `setPoolActive` function:

```solidity
    /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) { //@audit Change function declaration like that
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
