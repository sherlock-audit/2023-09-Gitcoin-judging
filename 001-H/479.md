# The attacker can freely make the `pool` to be `active` or `inactive` about `RFPSimpleStrategy`.
`RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive` did not contain any checks about `msg.sender`, so the attacker can freely make the `pool` to be `active` or `inactive`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#setPoolActive` is as following.
```solidity
File: RFPSimpleStrategy.sol
216:     /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
217:     /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
218:     /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
219:     function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
220:         _setPoolActive(_flag);
221:         emit PoolActive(_flag);
222:     }
```
This function is external and due to lack of the onlyPoolManager modifier, it can be called by anybody.
As we can see from the description of this function, `msg.sender` has to be `pool manager`.
But the real implementation of this function didn't check about `msg.sender`.

## Impact
The attacker can freely make the `pool` to be `active` or `inactive` using `RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive`.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
`RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#setPoolActive` has to check `msg.sender` like following.
```solidity
File: RFPSimpleStrategy.sol
216:     /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
217:     /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
218:     /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
219: -    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
219: +    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
220:         _setPoolActive(_flag);
221:         emit PoolActive(_flag);
222:     }
```
