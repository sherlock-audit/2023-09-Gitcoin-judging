# Allocator can allocate as much voice credits as he wants
## Summary
In [QVSimpleStrategy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol) an allocator can allocate as much voice credits as he wants. This is happening because the total allocated amount for this allocator never increases.

## Vulnerability Detail
When an allocator calls [allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L352-L354) in **Allo**, it triggers the **BaseStrategy**'s [allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L182-L186) which in tern calls [_allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L107-L124) in **QVSimpleStrategy** where our issue begins. [_allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L107-L124) checks for if the allocator [has spend](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L121) it's credits.
```solidity
if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();
```
However it misses to assign those to be "spend credits" to the allocator, leaving  `allocator.voiceCredits` at 0. This means that an allocator can call `allocate` multiple time with the only condition, that the current allocation is bellow `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`, as due to [this check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L150):
```solidity
    function _hasVoiceCreditsLeft(uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate, uint256 _allocatedVoiceCredits) internal view override returns (bool)
    {
        return _voiceCreditsToAllocate + _allocatedVoiceCredits <= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator;
    }
```

## Impact
Allocator can allocate as many votes as he pleases. He can also use these allocations to steal the rewards ( [_getPayout](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L571) calculates the rewards on the number of votes ), by allocating most of the votes to himself or a trusted recipient.  
 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal virtual override {
        (address recipientId, uint256 voiceCreditsToAllocate) = abi.decode(_data, (address, uint256));

        Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
        Allocator storage allocator = allocators[_sender];

        if (!_isValidAllocator(_sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
        if (!_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId)) revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);

         //@audit H allocator.voiceCredits stay at 0 always, he can call this multiple times
        if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();

        _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Increase ` allocator.voiceCredits`:
```diff
    function _allocate(...) internal virtual override {
        if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();
+       allocator.voiceCredits += voiceCreditsToAllocate;

        _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
    }
```
