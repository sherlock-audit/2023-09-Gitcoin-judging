# voiceCredits not accumulated
## Summary

VoiceCredits are not accumulated resulting in an Allocator being able to vote without limit, thus affecting the amount distributed to Recipients

## Vulnerability Detail

The _allocate method limits the maximum number of votes each allocator can assign to a recipient by calling _hasVoiceCreditsLeft, as shown in the code marked //found below

```solidity
    function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal virtual override {
...
        // check that the recipient has voice credits left to allocate
        if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID(); // found

        _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
    }
```


The value of allocator.voiceCredits will always be equal to 0 without accumulation. That is, as long as voiceCreditsToAllocate is less than maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator, the allocator can keep voting until the data overflows. The voting results directly affect the distribution of the amount, as shown in the code marked //found below.
```solidity
    function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (PayoutSummary memory)
    {
        Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];

        // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
        uint256 amount;
        if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
            amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes; // found
        }
        return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Accumulate the voiceCreditsToAllocate used each time into allocator.voiceCredits
