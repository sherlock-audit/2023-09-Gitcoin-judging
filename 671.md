# Unsafe downcasting can lead to integer truncation
## Summary

The values used in _getUintRecipientStatus  are unsafely downcasted from uint256 to uint8 which may lead to an incorrect recipient status. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When uint’s are being casted to different sizes, Solidity does not revert if there is some kind of integer truncation occurs which is where part of the value is cut short. See the following example: 

```solidity
/// @notice Get recipient status
/// @param _recipientId ID of the recipient
/// @return status The status of the recipient
function _getUintRecipientStatus(address _recipientId) internal view returns (uint8 status) {
    // Get the column index and current row
    (, uint256 colIndex, uint256 currentRow) = _getStatusRowColumn(_recipientId);

    // Get the status from the 'currentRow' shifting by the 'colIndex'
    status = uint8((currentRow >> colIndex) & 15); 
    // Return the status
    return status;
}
```

As we can see the `_getUintRecipientStatus` `currentRow` and `colIndex` are both `uint256` values that are downcasted to `uint8` which can be truncated. 

## Impact

If certain edge cases conditions are met and integer truncation exists, the recipient status may not be accurate when it comes to allocating tokens to the recipient via `_allocate` resulting in a denial of service. The following proof of concept is an overly simplified and straightforward example of integer truncation created in remix:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0

pragma solidity >=0.8.2 <0.9.0;

contract Storage {

    function test() public view returns(uint8) {

        uint256 testuint = type(uint256).max;
        return uint8(testuint);
    }
}
```

the `testuint` value was assigned the max that a `uint256` value can hold however, this value was downcasted to `uint8` resulting in integer truncation. So instead of returning `1157920892373161954………`  , `255` is returned because this is the maximum amount a `uint8` can hold.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It’s recommended that the values in being downcasted remain as `uint256` or OpenZeppelin’s `SafeCast` library is used to safely downcast these values.
