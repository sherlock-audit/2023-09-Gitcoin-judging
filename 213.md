# Protocol does not really work with fee-on-transfers tokens
## Summary
Protocol does not handle well when ERC20 fee-on-transfers and rebasing token is used

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `Allo#_fundPool` directly increase `poolAmount` variable with calculated variable of value that being calculated after fee:

    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
increasePoolAmount function:

    function increasePoolAmount(uint256 _amount) external override onlyAllo {
        _beforeIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
        poolAmount += _amount;
        _afterIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
    }
When token is fee-on-transfers token, the actual token amount is not same as old amount of token, which make different between `poolAmount` variable and actual number of token in pool

## Impact
Some functions can be failed to execute due to lack of token in pool

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use pre-and-post balance pattern to get actual number of token deposited
