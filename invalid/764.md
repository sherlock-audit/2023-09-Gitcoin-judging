# Paying fees could be avoided when in the fundPool function

Paying fees could be avoided when in the `Allo#fundPool` function

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `Allo#fundPool` function at line 510, the value of `feeAmount` could be resulted in 0 if the funding amount is small enough. This could be exploited by making multiple funding calls on some of the cheap EVM chains, leading to avoiding paying protocol fees.

## Impact

Paying fees could be avoided when in the `Allo#fundPool` function

## Code Snippet

File: Allo.sol
502:     function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
503:         uint256 feeAmount;
504:         uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;
505: 
506:         Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
507:         address _token = pool.token;
508: 
509:         if (percentFee > 0) {
510:             feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator(); 
511:             amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;
512: 
513:             _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
514:         }
515: 
516:         _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee})); /
517:         //_strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);
518: 
519:         emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
520:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding checks that if `percentFee` is not equal to 0 then the paid fee amount should also be not 0.
