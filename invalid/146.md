# Incorrect fund verification in the `_createPool` function
The `_createPool` function in the Allo contract verify user-provided funds for both NATIVE and non-NATIVE token. However, the function incorrectly checks whether the user has sent the required funds and reverts when the exact required amount of funds is provided, even though such a scenario should be valid.

## Vulnerability Detail
For the NATIVE token, the function checks if the sum of `baseFee` and `_amount` is greater than or equal to msg.value. For non-NATIVE tokens, it checks if `baseFee` is greater than or equal to msg.value. However, in both cases the function will mistakenly revert, even when the user provides the exact required amount.
```solidity
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
```
## Impact
Users will face excessive unexpected transaction failures, even if they send the exact required amount, which will lead to a loss of trust in the protocol due to a poor experience.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the function will accept transactions when users send the exact required amount, what can lead to 
```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
    revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
}
```
