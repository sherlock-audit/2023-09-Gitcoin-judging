# Missing zero address check on recipient address

Potential for Unintended Fund Burning in **recoverFunds** Function

## Vulnerability Detail

The **recoverFunds** function in the provided contract facilitates the recovery of any mistakenly sent funds, be it native Ether or ERC20 tokens. However, there is an oversight in the function, as it lacks a check to prevent the **_recipient** from being the zero address. Sending funds to the zero address is equivalent to burning them, rendering the funds permanently inaccessible.

## Impact

If an owner mistakenly sets the **_recipient** to the zero address and invokes the **recoverFunds** function, the funds intended for recovery will be irrevocably burned. Depending on the amount of funds involved, this could lead to significant financial losses.

## Recommendation

To address this vulnerability, it is advised to add a condition at the beginning of the **recoverFunds** function to check if the **_recipient** address is the zero address.
