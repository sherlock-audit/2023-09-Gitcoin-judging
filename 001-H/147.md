# Unauthorized modification of pool status in `setPoolActive` function
The `setPoolActive` function in RFPSimpleStrategy contract, which toggles the active status of the pool, lacks proper access controls. This allows any user to change this status, disrupting the pool's intended functionality.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `setPoolActive` function is designed to toggle the pool's active state. If a pool is set to inactive, certain operations, such as withdrawals by the pool manager, can be performed, whereas when the pool is active, other operations, like registering recipients, are possible.
However, the function lacks the necessary access controls checks to ensure that only authorized entities can invoke this change.

```solidity
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
## Impact
Any user can deactivate an active pool or activate an inactive pool, disrupting the pool's standard operations and the intentions of its managers and participants.
