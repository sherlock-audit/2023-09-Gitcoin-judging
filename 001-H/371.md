# Missing access control in function setPoolActive allows bad actors to DOS multiple functions

Missing modifier in function setPoolActive allows bad actors to DOS multiple functions with the contract 

## Vulnerability Detail

Observe the following code

 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L216-L222

The comments suggest that the function setPoolactive should be called by a pool manager. However, there is no such access control on the function, allowing anyone to call it. This is very dangerous as it allows anyone to frontrun and disable functions such as _allocate which checks on the status of a pool

Other functions that rely on the status of the pool to execute are _registerRecipient and _distribute.

## Impact

Several functions can be DOS due to a lack of access control on the function setPoolActive
