# Creating a pool with baseFee can revert if amount is set to correct value.

When creating a pool and there is a `baseFee` to be paid, it can revert if the amount is set correctly.

## Vulnerability Detail

in the `createPool` function there can be a baseFee, which is to be charged. This is done in the NATIVE token. As the `_transferAmountFrom` function is checking against the `msg.value` for the transferred amount only. To account for the case if the pool token is the native token there is a check for the `msg.value` to be greater than the amount and baseFee. 

```solidity  
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
```
 
However this check is also reverting if the `msg.value`  is set to the exact right  amount.

## Impact

CreatePool Transaction is reverting even if the correct amount is set.
