# Allocators can manipulate `_getPayout` by voting with small amounts
## Summary
Due to how [_getPayout](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L559-L574) calculates the payout, voters can manipulate it by voting for different users with small amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
Allocators can vote for different recipients to manipulate [_getPayout](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L559-L574) accounting. [_distribute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L436-L465) uses `_getPayout` to calculate the amounts to distribute, thus the allocators effectively acquire more fund with the same amount of votes.

| *Prerequisites*                 | *Values* |
|---------------------------------|----------|
| Cause A allocators : recipients | 2 : 2    |
| Cause B allocators : recipients | 2 : 2    |
| Allocator                       | 4       |
| Recipients                      | 4       |
| Allocator voice credits         | 100      |

**Normal voting**

The 2 allocators of cause **A** vote 100 voice credits for each recipient of cause A, and side B does the same. This will result in every recipient to have 10 votes, since the calculation for the votes is `sqrt(voice credits allocated) => sqrt(100) => 10` ( [_qv_allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L522)). All of the funds will be slit equally, because all 4 recipients ( 2 for **A** and 2 for **B** ) will each have 10 votes => 40 cotes in total => 25% of the funds are send for every 10 votes.

**Manipulation tactic**

However on the next vote, one side will manipulate the votes, lest say **A**, while **B** will do the same as before. The allocators of **A** will each vote 50 votes to their 2 recepients `sqrt(50) => 7.07` and each recepient of **cause A** will receive 
`2 * 7.07 = 14.14` votes. This will result in 2 recipients of **cause A** having 14.14 votes each and 2 recipients of **cause B** having 10 votes each. 

With total of 48.28 vote **party A** will hold **~58.5%** and **party B** will hold **~41.5%** of the treasury. 
Effectively **party A** acquires more funds for **cause A** while having the same voting power.

## Impact
User able to manipulate the fund allocation of [_getPayout](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L559-L574).

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (PayoutSummary memory)
    {
        Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];

        // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
        uint256 amount;
        if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
            amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
        }
        return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Because of the way this entire protocol is implemented, I am unsure about the best solution for addressing this vulnerability.
