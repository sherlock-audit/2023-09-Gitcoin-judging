# a user can vote unlimited times
when a user allocate votes **allocator.voiceCredits** is not  updated which will lead to a user can vote unlimted times but each time the new amount should be less than the **maxVoiceCreditPerAllocator**
## Vulnerability Detail
when a user allocate votes **allocator.voiceCredits** is not updated which will always be 0 and the the function **QVSimpleStrategy.allocate** uses **allocator.voiceCredits** to check the remaining  amount  by subtracting the new amount the user wanted to allocate plus allocator.voicecredit with **maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator* if it is grater than it will revert 
`if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID(); so the user can allocate vote many time but at one time the vote should always be less than or equal to **maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocato** 
## Impact
