# Lack of Existence Check for Target Contract in `execute` Function
## Summary
The `execute` function in the Anchor contract allows profile owners to execute calls to a target address. However, it lacks a crucial check for the existence of the target contract before making the call. This omission can potentially lead to Ether becoming stuck in the contract if the target contract does not exist.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `execute` function is intended to facilitate controlled interactions with external addresses. However, it does not include a check to verify the existence of the target contract before making the call. This can be problematic because of the behavior of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

In the EVM, the low-level `call` function returns `true` as its first return value if the account being called is non-existent. This means that if the target contract does not exist, the `call` function will still return `true`, and the function will proceed with the call, potentially resulting in Ether being sent to a non-existent contract, which effectively locks up the Ether.
Here is the relevant code snippet from the `execute` function:
```solidity
// Check if the target address is the zero address and revert if it is
if (_target == address(0)) revert CALL_FAILED();

// Call the target address and return the data
(bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_data);
// Check if the call was successful and revert if not
if (!success) revert CALL_FAILED();
```
The vulnerability lies in the fact that there is no check for the existence of `_target` before making the call.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is that Ether can become stuck in the contract if a user interacts with a non-existent target contract. This Ether would be effectively lost, as there would be no way to recover it.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, it is advisable to add a check for the existence of the target contract before making the call. This can be achieved by using the `extcodesize` assembly function to verify the code size at the target address. If the code size is zero, it indicates that the contract does not exist, and the function should revert with an appropriate error message.
```solidity
// Check if the target contract exists by verifying its code size
uint256 codeSize;
assembly {
    codeSize := extcodesize(_target)
}
if (codeSize == 0) revert CALL_FAILED();
```
This addition ensures that the `execute` function only proceeds with the call if the target contract actually exists, reducing the risk of Ether being stuck in the contract due to interactions with non-existent contracts.
