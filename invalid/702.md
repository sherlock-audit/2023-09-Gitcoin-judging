# Funds stored in anchor will be lost while upgrading anchor
## Summary
Anchors are deployed per profile and used by the owner of the anchor to manage funds and other usecases.  Anchors uses `registry.sol`  as an access control  mechanism to check if the caller is the owner of the specific anchor to execute txns . And anchors can recieve funds through the recieve functionality .

However , In the `registry.sol` ,  an anchor of a profile can be updated . And while upgrading , information of old anchor is deleted .  This may get really problematic if an user upgrades his anchor. Because by upgrading , he will lose control over his old anchor and funds stored on that anchor . 
Which will cause  fund loss to the anchor owner. 


## Vulnerability Detail
The `execute` function in `Anchor.sol` : 
```solidity
    function execute(address _target, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) external returns (bytes memory) {
        // Check if the caller is the owner of the profile and revert if not
        if (!registry.isOwnerOfProfile(profileId, msg.sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED(); //<---call to registry contract to check if caller is the owner of the anchor 


        // rest of the code... 

```
` function updateProfileName` in `registry.sol` :  

```solidity
    function updateProfileName(bytes32 _profileId, string memory _name)
        external
        onlyProfileOwner(_profileId)
        returns (address anchor)
    {
        // Generate a new anchor address
        anchor = _generateAnchor(_profileId, _name);

        // Get the profile using the profileId from the mapping
        Profile storage profile = profilesById[_profileId];

        // Set the new name
        profile.name = _name;

        // Remove old anchor
        anchorToProfileId[profile.anchor] = bytes32(0); //<----deletes the old anchor address . 
        

//rest of the code .....

```
The demonstrated issue can happen this way : 
In a scenario where an user want to update his/her profile name then he/she will get a new anchor . But if there are remaining funds in his/her old anchor then he/she will lose the funds forever . 

## Impact
Permanent Loss of funds for the user .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The issue can be mitigated in multiple ways : 
1. By  not generating  a new anchor while updating profile name . (Best way) 
2. User should have control over his old anchor .
