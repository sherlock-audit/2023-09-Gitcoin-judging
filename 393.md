# Bypass of Allocation Step in DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy
## Summary
The DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy strategy contract allows funds to be directly distributed to recipients without the necessary prerequisite of allocation. This discrepancy in the expected flow can lead to non-malicious misuse and mismanagement of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the designed sequence of interactions:

A PoolManager creates a new pool using the DonationVotingMerkle strategy.
Alice is registered as a recipient in the pool.
The PoolManager reviews the registered recipients.
The PoolManager uploads the root and initiates the distribution of funds to recipients.
However, the DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy strategy does not enforce the allocation step before the distribution step.
The  [_distribute function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L609-L633), calls [_distributeSingle](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L774-L799), a function that only validates the distribution by checking if index, recipientId, recipientAddress, amount, merkleProof of the distribution make up for a leaf at an already created distribution merkle tree. It is missing the obligatory allocation requirement by not verifying if the receiver is truly an allocation receiver.

This means that after registering a recipient, the PoolManager can bypass the allocation phase and directly proceed to distribute funds to the registered recipient. This doesn't seem intentional as the strategy does implement the [_allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L640-L665) function.

## Impact

Bypassing Allocation: The lack of strict checks means that there's no assurance that funds are properly accounted for or reserved for recipients before distribution. This might lead to potential misuse where more funds than intended or allocated are distributed.
Audit Trail: Skipping the allocation step disrupts the audit trail. Typically, allocation acts as a commitment or reservation of funds, which can then be audited or verified. Without this, it becomes difficult to track and verify the legitimacy of fund distributions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
State Management: Consider using state variables or mappings to track allocations. This will ensure that distributions do not exceed allocations and will also provide an audit trail. Mapping-based checks should be introduced to _distributeSingle in order to ensure the allocation flow is not skipped.
