# The Allo team's fee can be bypassed
## Summary

The Allo team's fee can be bypassed by forcing [`(_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L510)  to always round down.

## Vulnerability Detail

The attack can be done by calling `getPercentFee()` and `getFeeDenominator()` prior to creating a pool and funding it with an amount such that the division always rounds down.  `fundPool()` can then repeatedly be called with small amounts such that the pool is funded with the amount that the pool creator initially intended while ensuring the division always rounds down to 0.

## Recommendation

Force the division to always round up using one of Solady's division functions from `FixedPointMathLib`.

```diff
- feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
+ feeAmount = FixedPointMathLib.mulWadUp(_amount * percentFee);
```
