# Owner can change milestone percentage when recipient already submited milestone
## Summary
Owner can change milestone percentage when recipient already submited milestone
## Vulnerability Detail
`RFPSimpleStrategy.setMilestones` is called by owner to provide amount of milestones and payout percentage for them.
It's not allowed to change this, once [at least 1 milestone is accepted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L228). This makes sense as deal is agreed and it's not fair to change distribution.

However, owner still can change milestones as many times as he wishes, before he accepts 1 milestone. This is wrong, because recipient may already submited that 1 milestone and now owner has ability to decrease payment for milestone or change milestones amount. 
## Impact
Owner has ability to full recipient.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I believe that once milestones are submitted, then they should not be changed. Or give ability to change them as many times as needed, but when some flag is marked that means that work has begun and no more changes allowed.
