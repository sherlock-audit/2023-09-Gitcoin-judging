# Potential frontrunning vulnerability where an attacker could manipulate the native asset amount after it is checked but before the transaction reverts
Potential frontrunning vulnerability where an attacker could manipulate the native asset amount after it is checked but before the transaction reverts
## Vulnerability Detail
The key code is in the _allocate function: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L658-L659)
This first checks that if a native token is being used, the msg.value matches the expected amount. However, there is a window between this check and the revert where the msg.value could be manipulated by a frontrunning bot.

Here is how the attack would work:
1. Attacker sees a transaction calling _allocate with a native token and checks the msg.value matches the amount
2. Attacker frontruns the transaction and calls a function that manipulates the msg.value (e.g. by sending ETH to the contract)
3. The original transaction continues and now reverts due to the msg.value mismatch

## Impact
This can be used to grief legitimate transactions by causing unexpected reverts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
The msg.value check and revert should happen atomically as one step:
if (msg.value != amount) {
  revert INVALID(); 
}
This prevents any opportunity for the msg.value to be manipulated between the check and revert.
