# Missing receive function in Strategy contracts, which bricks the entire function
## Summary
The smart contract lacks the `receive() payable` functions in the strategy contracts, which results in unexpected behavior when attempting to deposit native tokens into pools. The absence of these functions prevents the contract from properly handling native tokens, rendering them unusable for pools. It is essential to implement the `receive() payable` functions to enable the intended functionality of the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability pertains to the absence of the `receive() payable` functions in the strategy contracts. These functions are crucial for handling native tokens in Ethereum-based smart contracts. Without them, the contract cannot accept native tokens, causing unexpected behavior and preventing users from participating in pools with native tokens.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it restricts the use of native tokens within the pools, making them unusable for depositors. Users attempting to interact with the contract using native tokens will encounter issues, and their transactions may fail or revert, leading to a poor user experience and potential frustration.

## Tool used
>PoC
```solidity
function testRevert_nativePool() public {
        allo().addToCloneableStrategies(strategy);

        //vm.expectEmit(true, true, false, false);
        emit PoolCreated(
            1,
            poolProfile_id(),
            IStrategy(strategy),
            NATIVE,
            5e18,
            metadata
        );

        vm.prank(pool_admin());
        vm.deal(pool_admin(), 50 ether);
        vm.expectRevert();
        uint256 poolId = allo().createPool{value: 5 ether}(
            poolProfile_id(),
            strategy,
            "0x",
            NATIVE,
            5e18,
            metadata,
            pool_managers()
        );
    }
```

## Recommendation
Adding receive function in all strategy contracts
```solidity
 receive() external payable {}
```
