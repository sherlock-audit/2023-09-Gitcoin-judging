# Allocators in QVSimpleStrategy can allocate far beyond the maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator

`allocator.voiceCredits` is never incremented, instead staying at 0 permanently. This allows allocators to allocate the `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` over and over.

## Vulnerability Detail

Allocators are intended to have a limited amount of voice credits which they can allocate, enforced by `QVSimpleStrategy._hasVoiceCreditsLeft` which takes `allocator.voiceCredits` as a parameter to validate the total amount of credits used, including those to be used in the current execution, do not exceed `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`. However, since `allocator.voiceCredits` is never changed, this limit is not enforced.

## Impact

Allocators can allocate the `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` over and over without any limit.

```solidity
// check that the recipient has voice credits left to allocate
if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();
```

```solidity
function _hasVoiceCreditsLeft(uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate, uint256 _allocatedVoiceCredits)
    internal
    view
    override
    returns (bool)
{
    return _voiceCreditsToAllocate + _allocatedVoiceCredits <= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`allocator.voiceCredits` should be incremented by the amount currently being allocated every time `_allocate` is called.
