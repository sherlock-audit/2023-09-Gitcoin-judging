# Unchecked return value in `Allo._fundPool`
Unchecked return value in `Allo._fundPool`

## Vulnerability Detail
A  vulnerability is present due to the "unchecked return value"  in _transferAmountFrom function calls. This vulnerability arises from the lack of proper error handling and verification of the return values of these transfer operations.

## Impact
The vulnerability in the _fundPool function, where _transferAmountFrom failures are not appropriately handled, as we can see that _transferAmountFrom() returns bool value, this allows users to potentially exploit it to their advantage. While the function emits the "PoolFunded" event even in the case of transfer failures, users may not actually transfer their tokens as intended. This could create a misleading situation where the contract emits a success event, giving the impression that the transaction was successful, when in fact, tokens were not transferred.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;
            
            //@audit unchecked return value
            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        //@audit unchecked return value
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
