# Accepted recipient could get more amount than the `proposalBid`  value
## Summary
In the contract `RFPSimpleStrategy`, the function `setMilestones` is intended to set milestones at exactly 100%. However, the function allows multiple calls to be made, which may cause the `amountPercentage` of milestones to exceed 100%, resulting in extra funds being transferred to the `approvedRecipientId` beyond the intended amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `setMilestones` function permits the `poolManager` to set milestones using the `setMilestones` function. This is checked to ensure that milestones are not already set by the following condition:

```solidity 
if (upcomingMilestone != 0) revert MILESTONES_ALREADY_SET();
```
However, multiple calls can be made until the `_distribute` function is invoked, which increments the value of `upcomingMilestone`. This could cause the `amountPercentage` to exceed 100%.

Before `acceptedRecipient` submits the milestone, if `setMilestones` function is called again, milestones would be pushed to array at end and there is no check to ensure the total percentage in the array is less equal to 100. So adding milestones twice would give the recipient 200% of the recipient bid.


## Impact

If the `proposalBid` of `acceptedRecipientId` is less than the `poolAmount`, the `recipientAddress` of `acceptedRecipientId` receives more tokens, than the issued limit (100%).

## POC

```solidity
/// File: RFPSimpleStrategy.t.sol

    function testMilestones() public {
        __setMilestones();
        __setMilestones();
        uint totalPercentage;
        for (uint x; x < 4;) {
            (uint percentage_, , ) = strategy.milestones(x);
            totalPercentage += percentage_;
            unchecked {
                x++;
            }
        }
        assertEq(totalPercentage, 2e18); // 200%
    }
```

## Recommendation
```diff
function setMilestones(Milestone[] memory _milestones) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
-        if (upcomingMilestone != 0) revert MILESTONES_ALREADY_SET();
+        if (milestones.length != 0) revert MILESTONES_ALREADY_SET();
```
