# ` _qv_allocate`  doesn't check `_recipientstatus`
QvBaseStrategy#  ` _qv_allocate`  doesn't check `_recipientstatus` ,
## Vulnerability Detail
` _qv_allocate` is  to allocate voice credits to a recipient, once allocated, the amount of funds to distribute  is known. 
The issue  is    `_qv_allocate`  don't  check  recipent status.
In  `_distribte` , we  check `_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId) `  make sure  _recipientstatus equlas status accept.
```solidity
  if (paidOut[recipientId] || !_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId) || amount == 0) {
                revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
            }
```

Due to the payout calculate method ,  every allocated recipent should have a percentage payout, if  a not  accepted status recipient get allocated ,  some part of fund will get stuck in contract.
```solidity
  function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (PayoutSummary memory)
    {
        Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];

        // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
        uint256 amount;
        if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
            amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
        }
        return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
    }
   
  ``` 
   
## Impact
Fund cannot fully distribute.
