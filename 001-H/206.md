# Lack of onlyPoolManager in RFPSimpleStrategy#setPoolActive lead to DOS of many functions
Lack of onlyPoolManager in RFPSimpleStrategy#setPoolActive lead to DOS of many functions

## Vulnerability Detail
In RFPSimpleStrategy#setPoolActive, there is no modifier to make sure that msg.sender must be a pool manager to close the pool like in dev's note:

    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
It lead to anyone can call `setPoolActive` function and fron-running to DOS functions that use onlyActivePool and onlyActivePool like `withdraw`, `_distribute`, `_registerRecipient`, `_allocate`

## Impact
Any function that use onlyActivePool and onlyInactivePool can be front-run and DOS

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add onlyPoolManager modifier to function:

function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
    _setPoolActive(_flag);
    emit PoolActive(_flag);
}
