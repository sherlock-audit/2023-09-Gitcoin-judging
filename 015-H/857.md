# Malicious recipient can unfairly get more funding in RFP strategies
## Summary
If a recipient gets picked by a committee in RFP strategy they might frontrun `_allocate` with a much higher `proposalBid`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`ProposalBid` can be changed right before `_allocate` allowing a recipient to get more funding unfairly.
