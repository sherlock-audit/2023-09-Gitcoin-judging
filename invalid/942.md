# Potential funds stuck in QVBaseStrategy
## Summary
In `QVBaseStrategy` contract, recipient's payout is calculated based on total votes received proportionally to total global votes, multiplied with total pool amount. While the contract does not have any withdraw function for pool manager, there will be potential stuck funds in contract because of rounding down calculation

## Vulnerability Detail
Payout amounts formula `amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes`. Here `amount` will be rounded down and there will be `(poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived) % totalRecipientVotes` amount of token stuck in the contract for **each payout**. As long as `totalRecipientVotes` is large enough, stuck funds will be large (depends on value range of voice credits to be used).

## Impact
There will be potential stuck funds in pools
