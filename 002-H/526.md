# Anyone can activate or deactivate RFP strategy pools at anytime due to missing access control, DOS funds withdrawal and distribution
## Summary
RFPSimpleStrategy and RFPCommitteeStrategy apply `onlyActivePool` and `onlyInactivePool` to limit key actions such as `registerRecipient`, `allocate`, and `distribute`. For example, `distribute` can only be called when pool is inactive.

However, key function to flip pool active status `setPoolActive()` doesn't have any access control, which allows anyone to toggle pool state at any time. This will put the pool in an undesirable state at any time decided by a malicious caller.
## Vulnerability Detail
Notice that `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol`, unlike other strategies in scope, enforces pool active status control on key pool actions.
For example, in RFPSimpleStrategy.sol - `_distribute()` , `onlyInactivePool` modifier is in place to ensure that only when allocation process is finished will pool managers be able to distribute funds. Similarly in `_registerRecipient()` and `_allocate()`, `onlyActivePool` modifier is in place. In `withdraw()`, `onlyInactivePool` is in place.

```solidity
//RFPSimpleStrategy.sol
    function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {...
```
However, the vulnerability is that pool active status can actually be toggled by anyone at any time due to missing access control in `setPoolActive()`. Even though the function doc `@dev` describes only pool manager can call this function, this is not implemented either externally or internally.

```solidity
//RFPSimpleStrategy.sol
    /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
|>  function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
``` 
```solidity
//BaseStrategy.sol
    /// @notice Set the pool to active or inactive status.
    /// @dev This will emit a 'PoolActive()' event. Used by the strategy implementation.
    /// @param _active The status to set, 'true' means active, 'false' means inactive
    function _setPoolActive(bool _active) internal {
        poolActive = _active;
        emit PoolActive(_active);
    }
```
As a result, a malicious caller can simply toggle pool's active status to prevent pool actions:

For example, (1) when a caller can prevent `registerRecipient()` by front run the transaction and toggle the pool to inactive causing the transaction to revert;  (2) Or a caller can prevent fund distribution by front run the pool manager's `distribute` call and toggle the pool to active, causing pool manager transaction to revert; (3) Or in the context of RFPSimpleStrategy, a caller can prevent `recipientId` to be accepted. (4) Or a caller can also prevent funds to be withdrawn from the pool by front run pool manager's call to `withdraw()`, causing funds to be locked in the pool.

Note that both RFPCommitteStrategy.sol and RFPSimpleStrategy.sol are impacted. 

## Impact
Key pool actions can be prevented and funds can be locked in the pool as detailed above. I consider this is high severity due to how easy and cheap the attack can be and how key registration process, fund allocation, distribution, and withdrawal processes can be DOS. And funds can be locked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `onlyPoolManager` modifier on `setPoolActive()`.
