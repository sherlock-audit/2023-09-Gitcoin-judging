# The review threshold can be easily bypassed by any manager
The review threshold can be easily bypassed by any manager

## Vulnerability Detail
To register a new recipient, a specific threshold must be met:

```solidity
reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus] >= reviewThreshold
```

Pool managers can vote to approve add of a new recipient by calling the `reviewRecipients` function. Unfortunately, there is no check to ensure that a manager has not already voted for this recipient. Consequently, if `reviewThreshold = 5`, a pool manager can call the `reviewRecipients` function five times and single-handedly approve the recipient.

The review threshold can be easily bypassed by any manager by calling the function as many times as necessary to approve the recipient.

## Impact
Unwanted recipient can be added.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function reviewRecipients(address[] calldata _recipientIds, Status[] calldata _recipientStatuses)
        external
        virtual
        onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)
        onlyActiveRegistration
    {
        // make sure the arrays are the same length
        uint256 recipientLength = _recipientIds.length;
        if (recipientLength != _recipientStatuses.length) revert INVALID();

        for (uint256 i; i < recipientLength;) {
            Status recipientStatus = _recipientStatuses[i];
            address recipientId = _recipientIds[i];

            // if the status is none or appealed then revert
            if (recipientStatus == Status.None || recipientStatus == Status.Appealed) {
                revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
            }

            reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus]++;

            if (reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus] >= reviewThreshold) {
                Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
                recipient.recipientStatus = recipientStatus;

                emit RecipientStatusUpdated(recipientId, recipientStatus, address(0));
            }

            emit Reviewed(recipientId, recipientStatus, msg.sender);

            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if the manager has already voted for this recipient.
