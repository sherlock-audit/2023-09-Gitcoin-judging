# Adversary can steal  99% of  the depositor funds by deploying  a malicious custom Strategy

Adversary can create a malicious pool with a `customStrategy ` where users can fund into it , this  will allow the adversary to 
directly steal user funds. 


## Vulnerability Detail

Once a user creates a profile , a member of the profile or the profile owner can create a pool with a strategy,
So an  adversary  can create a custom Strategy by passing a malicious strategy address to `allo::createPoolWithCustomStrategy()`
 Check is `if (_isCloneableStrategy(_strategy)) revert IS_APPROVED_STRATEGY();` so it is not true  therefore we can create a custom strategy passing  any address we like ,   

Consider  a scenario ,
1. Alice  wants to fund a pool . 
2. Adversary  creates a  custom Strategy pool  with a malicious  intention.  
3. Adversary  promotes the pool by impersonating the protocol brand saying fund the pool with this `pool_id` 
4.  Alice  interact with the frond-end to fund the pool with `pool _id`, this will result in immediate loss of  funds  ,creating  a bad reputation to the protocol.
 Also all of the functions which calls  the specific `strategyPool` through `Allo.sol` is now in control of adversary .He can implement what ever to do with it.

}

}

```

```bash
 ├─ [9479] StratergyCustom::receive{value: 990000000000000000}() 
    │   │   ├─ [0] Adversary::fallback{value: 990000000000000000}() 
    │   │   │   └─ ← ()
```
We were able to steal 99 % of ETH a user deposited to the   pool and rest is paid as the protocol  fee  to the `Treasury`

## Impact

Result in loss of user funds /tokens

## Code Snippet

```js

 function createPoolWithCustomStrategy(
        bytes32 _profileId,
        address _strategy,
        bytes memory _initStrategyData,
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        Metadata memory _metadata,
        address[] memory _managers
    ) external payable returns (uint256 poolId) {
        // Revert if the strategy address passed is the zero address with 'ZERO_ADDRESS()'
        if (_strategy == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

        // Revert if we already have this strategy in our cloneable mapping with 'IS_APPROVED_STRATEGY()' (only non-cloneable strategies can be used)
        if (_isCloneableStrategy(_strategy)) revert IS_APPROVED_STRATEGY();

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider introducing a validation method to validate custom strategies  before a user creates a pool using a custom strategy.
Something like validating a governance proposal. Also remember an attacker can still create metamorphic contracts just like 
the tornando cash governance attack vector.       

```diff
+   if(!_isApprovedCustomStratergy(address(stratergy))) revert IS_APPROVED_CUSTOM_STRATEGY();

or else you can set in allo::createPoolWithCustomStrategy() as it is,

-   if (_isCloneableStrategy(_strategy)) revert IS_APPROVED_STRATEGY();
+   if (!_isCloneableStrategy(_strategy)) revert IS_APPROVED_STRATEGY();

```
Also Consider adding a `WARNING` on the front end if users try to interact with  `customStrategies`  created by arbitrary users  other than using default Clonable Strategies provided by the protocol
