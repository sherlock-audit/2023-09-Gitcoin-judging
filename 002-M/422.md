# fee-on-transfer tokens can cause stuck of funds
## Summary
fee-on-transfer tokens can cause stuck of funds

## Vulnerability Detail
In the DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol contract, an amount of tokens is transferred from an allocator to the contract and the amount transferred is saved in a mapping. The protocol allows arbitrary ERC20s to be used, meaning that an account can allocate fee-on-transfer tokens. If he allocates 100 tokens, the full amount will not be transferred (as some tokens charge a transfer fee), although the mapping will store the full amount. Later, when the recipient wants to claim their tokens, they will not be able to withdraw 100 tokens, even though the mapping stores that they have 100 tokens.

## Impact
The recipient won't be able to withdraw the funds and they will be stuck.  

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _afterAllocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal override {
        // Decode the '_data' to get the recipientId, amount and token
        (address recipientId, Permit2Data memory p2Data) = abi.decode(_data, (address, Permit2Data));


        // Get the token address
        address token = p2Data.permit.permitted.token;
        uint256 amount = p2Data.permit.permitted.amount;


        if (token == NATIVE) {
            if (msg.value < amount) {
                revert AMOUNT_MISMATCH();
            }
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(address(this), amount);
        } else {
            PERMIT2.permitTransferFrom(
                // The permit message.
                p2Data.permit,
                // The transfer recipient and amount.
                ISignatureTransfer.SignatureTransferDetails({to: address(this), requestedAmount: amount}),
                // Owner of the tokens and signer of the message.
                _sender,
                // The packed signature that was the result of signing
                // the EIP712 hash of `_permit`.
                p2Data.signature
            );
        }


        // Update the total payout amount for the claim
        claims[recipientId][token] += amount;
    }
}

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use balance before and after check to make sure the saved amount in the mapping is the accurate amount of token when a token transfer is performed.
