# `setPoolActive` in `RFPSimpleStrategy` contract is missing an access modifier

## Summary

`setPollActive` is used to signal the active status of a strategy and is also used in combination with the modifiers `onlyActivePool` and `onlyInactivePool` when distributing, registring a recipient or withdrawing from the pool.


## Vulnerability Detail

Multiple comments inside the contract states that this method can only be called by a the pool manager.

but the method is missing the modifier `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` that prevents other accounts from calling this method and setting the pool active status.

## Impact

Without this modifier anyone can interfere with the pool manager account when distributing, registering a recipient or when withdrawing from the pool.
