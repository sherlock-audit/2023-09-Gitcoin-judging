# Missing access control on setPoolActive
Missing access control on setPoolActive in `RFPSimpleStrategy`, the `setPoolActive` function is used to either pause or unpause the pool for a specific strategy which should only be allowed by the manager of the pool as stated in the comments:

```solidity
/// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
