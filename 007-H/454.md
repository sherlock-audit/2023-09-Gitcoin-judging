# Registry Address Assignment Vulnerability in Anchor Contract Deployment using CREATE3
## Summary
The problem occurs when deploying the Anchor contract using the `CREATE3` library. In the constructor of the Anchor contract, it uses `msg.sender` as the registry contract address. However, because of the `CREATE3` library, a temporary proxy contract address is assigned to `msg.sender` during deployment. This leads to an incorrect assignment of the registry variable, causing the execute method to encounter an error and fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the incorrect usage of `msg.sender` as the registry address in the Anchor contract's constructor. Within `_generateAnchor` method in `Registry.sol` contract, it uses `CREATE3` library to deploy new contract like this.
```solidity
bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_profileId, _name));
address preCalculatedAddress = CREATE3.getDeployed(salt);
......

// check if the contract has already been deployed by checking code size of address
bytes memory creationCode = abi.encodePacked(type(Anchor).creationCode, abi.encode(_profileId));

// Use CREATE3 to deploy the anchor contract
anchor = CREATE3.deploy(salt, creationCode, 0);
```
And in the constructor of `Anchor.sol` , it use `msg.sender` as Registry contract address
```solidity
/// @notice Constructor
/// @dev We create an instance of the 'Registry' contract using the 'msg.sender' and set the profileId.
/// @param _profileId The ID of the allowed profile to execute calls
constructor(bytes32 _profileId) {
    registry = Registry(msg.sender);
    profileId = _profileId;
}
```
The `CREATE3` library assigns a temporary proxy contract address as `msg.sender` during deployment, resulting in the wrong value for the registry variable. This discrepancy causes the execute method to fail when making external calls due to the incorrect registry address.

## Impact
Any external calls relying on the registry functionality within the Anchor contract will not succeed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Instead of using `msg.sender`, pass the registry contract address as a parameter named `_registry` in the Anchor.sol constructor:
```solidity
constructor(bytes32 _profileId, address _registry) {
    registry = Registry(_registry);
    profileId = _profileId;
}
```
2. Include the address of the registry in the creationCode section:
```solidity
// check if the contract has already been deployed by checking code size of address
bytes memory creationCode = abi.encodePacked(type(Anchor).creationCode, abi.encode(_profileId), abi.encode(address(this)));

// Use CREATE3 to deploy the anchor contract
anchor = CREATE3.deploy(salt, creationCode, 0);
```
