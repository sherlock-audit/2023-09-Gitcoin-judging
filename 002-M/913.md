# Incompatibility with deflationary / fee-on-transfer tokens

The summary of the below-mentioned vulnerability is that, if the contract does not receive enough funds due to `fee-on-transfer` then it will not be able to transfer them to `recipients` when they `claims` the tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

<img width="773" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-21 at 7 06 42 PM" src="https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-alymurtazamemon/assets/56123405/0423b75d-1792-4e14-8762-c151a7f0b5eb">

The `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` contract works with all types of ERC20 tokens and some of them can be `fee-on-transfer` tokens which deduct tokens for a fee. It means this contract will receive less tokens than mentioned in the `SignatureTransferDetails`.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/// @notice After allocation hook to store the allocated tokens in the vault
/// @param _data The encoded recipientId, amount and token
/// @param _sender The sender of the allocation
function _afterAllocate(
    bytes memory _data,
    address _sender
) internal override {
```

[DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol - Line 107](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-distribution-vault/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol#L107)

The `_afterAllocate` gets called after the `allocate` function call in the base strategy contract and it stores the allocated tokens to recipients inside the vault.

```solidity
// Get the token address
address token = p2Data.permit.permitted.token;
uint256 amount = p2Data.permit.permitted.amount;

if (token == NATIVE) {
    if (msg.value < amount) {
        revert AMOUNT_MISMATCH();
    }

    SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(address(this), amount);
} else {
    PERMIT2.permitTransferFrom(
        // The permit message.
        p2Data.permit,
        // The transfer recipient and amount.
        ISignatureTransfer.SignatureTransferDetails({
            to: address(this),
            requestedAmount: amount
        }),
        // Owner of the tokens and signer of the message.
        _sender,
        // The packed signature that was the result of signing
        // the EIP712 hash of `_permit`.
        p2Data.signature
    );
}

// Update the total payout amount for the claim
claims[recipientId][token] += amount;
```

As we see in the `claims` mapping it updates the `claim` amount for `recipientId` defined in the allocate function.

## Impact

This way this contract will have less amount of tokens and when anyone calls the `claim` function, it will simply revert because the contract will not have enough funds to send to all recipients together because the mentioned amount will be greater than the contract balance.

## Tool used

Manual Review, Solodit

## Recommendation

Check the balance of the contracts before and after the transfer, compare their differences with the mentioned amount if the amount is less than mentioned then the contract can revert.
