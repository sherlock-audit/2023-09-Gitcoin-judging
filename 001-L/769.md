# When creating pool you need to send more value than the amount and baseFee, because of the check
## Summary
When creating pool you need to send more value than the amount and baseFee, because of the check
## Vulnerability Detail
In `_creatingPool` if the baseFee is greater than 0, it will make a second check if the baseFee + _amount is greater or equal to the msg.value,  if this is true it will revert. => This means that the user that is creating pools should ALWAYS send more ETH than the sum of _amount + baseFee;

This occurrer in the second check in this IF: https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L473C96-L473C116

if the token is not the Eth you need to send always more msg.value than the baseFee, but it should be greater or equal

## Impact
Losing funds from the creator of the pool

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It shouldn't revert if the msg.value is equal to _amount + baseFee

make the check, instead of: if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) 
to be : (_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)
