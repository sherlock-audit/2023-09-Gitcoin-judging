# QVBaseStrategy.sol#_qv_allocate() An allocator can allocate unlimited times
## Summary
An allocator can allocate unlimited times

## Vulnerability Detail
An allocator has voiceCredits that limit him on how many times he can allocate, however, he can allocate unlimited times.
There is a function that checks if the allocator has left voiceCredits before allocation but the problem is that his voiceCredits are not decreased after allocation, so he has unlimited voiceCredits.

Malicious allocator can allocate multiple times with high voteCredits values to the recipient he knows and make him have the highest totalVotesReceived which will make him receive the most funds from all of the recipients. Another possible scenario is to allocate with low voteCreadits values multiple times for the victim recipient.

## Impact
An allocator can allocate unlimited times

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _qv_allocate(
        Allocator storage _allocator,
        Recipient storage _recipient,
        address _recipientId,
        uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate,
        address _sender
    ) internal onlyActiveAllocation {
        // check the `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` is > 0
        if (_voiceCreditsToAllocate == 0) revert INVALID();

        // get the previous values
        uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
        uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId];

        // get the total credits and calculate the vote result
        uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
        uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);

        // update the values
        voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
        totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
        _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;

        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
        _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;

        // emit the event with the vote results
        emit Allocated(_recipientId, voteResult, _sender);
    }
