# Malicious user can spam create profiles for other users

The ```Registry.createProfile()``` allow any person to create profile for anyone else without any limitation.This open door for spammer to show off their spam artist talents.
## Vulnerability Detail

The ```Registry.createProfile()``` allow any person to create profile for anyone else without any limitation. Because of the way this protocol intend to be used , the person who the malicious user created the profile for can use that profile just by having the Id whiich was created from the keccak256 hash of the malicious user account and a random nonce; Although the the person who the malicious user created the profile for is not directly exposed to a loss of funds, this is still an issue as a spammer can create up to ```type(uint256).max``` number of profiles for the same victim account.

## Impact

Copy and paste this function into ```Registry.t.sol```
```solidity
function test_MaliciousUsersCreateProfileForOthers(
        string memory _name,
        address malicious_user,
        address owner1
    ) public {
        vm.assume(malicious_user != address(0));
        vm.assume(owner1 != address(0));
        vm.assume(owner2 != address(0));

        vm.startPrank(malicious_user);
        uint256 _nonce = 123;
        uint256 _nonce2 = 1234;
        bytes32 profileId_1 = registry().createProfile(_nonce, _name, metadata, owner1, profile1_members());
        bytes32 profileId_2 = registry().createProfile(_nonce2, _name, metadata, owner1, profile1_members());

        Registry.Profile memory profile1 = registry().getProfileById(profileId_1);
        Registry.Profile memory profile2 = registry().getProfileById(profileId_2);

        assertEq(profile1.id, profileId_1);
        assertEq(profile2.id, profileId_2);

    }
```
and run the test, it passes , so a spammer can create as many profile as he wants for his victims, and if by any mean he can trick the victims into using the profile Id, there is a possibility that he scams the victims.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend ensuring only the caller can create a profile for ```owner``` param. This can be done by reverting the function if owner param is not msg.sender.
