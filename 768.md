# Any acceptedRecicpeint can get to receive funds from the strategy
## Summary

This vulnerability presents itself because of the fact of using only three stages of checks before transferring the tokens to the recipient, this makes anyone to be able to receive the funds without actually reaching the milestone 

Status.pending, Status.accepted  and Status.Rejected

## Vulnerability Detail

In the distribute function of the RFPSImpleStrategy.sol when a approved poolManager wants to distribute funds to a particular recipient, there is no actually check if the recipient submitted milestone is actually a confirmed or even a rejected milestone, before they actually can proceed with the payment, this way individuals or companies can get paid even without them getting a check from the approved pool manager. 

But the surprising thing is that the check for if a milestone has been accepted is actually done after the funds have being transferred! which does not provide a good verification model

Let's explore a real life scenario

Imagine a community crowdfunding project for building a new park. The project has attracted several investors, and they want to set milestones for the release of funds as the project progresses. The project manager, who acts as the pool manager in this context, uses this function to define these milestones. The investors provide a list of milestones, each with a description and a percentage representing the completion required to release a portion of the funds. For example, the milestones could include: Land Acquisition (25%) Infrastructure Construction (50%) Landscaping and Beautification (20%) Final Inspection and Opening (5%) The percentages of these milestones are added up, and if they total 100%, the milestones are set using this function. Once set, funds will be allocated to the park project as each milestone is completed, ensuring that funds are released incrementally as the project progresses and milestones are met.

Now imagine if they whey two or three managers, 

Manager 1, says they are not satisfied, with the milestone presented, and rejects it 
Manager 2 does not know about the rejection and actually tries to pay the recipient for the completion of the milestone, that's a rejected milestone being paid for leading to a loss of funds for the profile. Even worse, the Manager can actually distribute funds to a recipient to a milestone that has not even gone through any reviews. The platform's intended democratic governance process is compromised 

## Impact

The vulnerability allows an accepted recipient to override those decisions and access funds for potentially incomplete or unsatisfactory work.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function submitUpcomingMilestone(Metadata calldata _metadata) external {
        // Check if the 'msg.sender' is the 'acceptedRecipientId' and is a member of the 'Profile'
        if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender && !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)) {
            revert UNAUTHORIZED();
        }

        // Check if the upcoming milestone is in fact upcoming
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

        // Get the milestone and update the metadata and status
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        milestone.metadata = _metadata;

        // Set the milestone status to 'Pending' to indicate that the milestone is submitted
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Pending;

        // Emit event for the milestone
        emit MilstoneSubmitted(upcomingMilestone);
    }
```
A acceptedRecipient can submit an upcoming milestone here for completion of a task, which the the community has already defined before, and they get their status updated to pending waiting from approval from the pool manager

```solidity
function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {
        // check to make sure there is a pending milestone
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

        IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        Recipient memory recipient = _recipients[acceptedRecipientId];

        // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
        if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();

        // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
        uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;

        // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
        poolAmount -= amount;
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

        // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;

        // Increment the upcoming milestone
        upcomingMilestone++;

        // Emit events for the milestone and the distribution
        emit MilestoneStatusChanged(upcomingMilestone, Status.Accepted);
        emit Distributed(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
    }
```
but in the recipent function, when a  poolManager wants to distibute and transfer the funds to the acceptedRecipent but their is no actual check if the recipent that submitted the milestone, milestone is actually a rejected milestone or any indication that the milestone submitted has being reviewed in any ways

## Tool used
Foundry Hardhat

## Recommendation
Implement a Two-Step-Approval Process in which a already reviewed milestone has already been viewed and not just rejected, like a Status.Pending and a Status.Approved then after transferring the tokens the Status.Executed should be present. The check for if a milestone status is Pending or Rejected should revert the distribute function to prevent a complete breach of the strategy main functions.
