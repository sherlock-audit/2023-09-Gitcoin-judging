# Potential DoS Attack Vector in `RFPSimpleStrategy:withdraw`
## Summary
The bug in the `RFPSimpleStrategy:withdraw` function allows a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack if PoolManager pass a 0 amount again and again.

## Vulnerability Detail
PoolManager can repeatedly call `RFPSimpleStrategy:withdraw` with 0 amounts, consuming gas resources and potentially causing network congestion. 

Same bug is also belong in DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy:withdraw
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L394

## Impact
PoolManager can exploit this vulnerability to consume excessive gas resources, leading to higher gas fees and transaction delays. 

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L295
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) onlyInactivePool {
        // Decrement the pool amount
        poolAmount -= _amount;   //@audit dos attack could be happen by calling 0 value again and again

        // Transfer the amount to the pool manager
        _transferAmount(allo.getPool(poolId).token, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
 ```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The function should include a check to ensure that _amount is greater than 0.
