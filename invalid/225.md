# DoS if the _createPool() is called and if `manager == address(0)`
DoS if the _createPool() is called and if `manager == address(0)`
## Vulnerability Detail
In _createPool() 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L459-L466

in this for loop if one of the ```manager == address(0)``` then the loop will never increment because of 
```Solidity
unchecked {
  ++i;
   }
```
 and will DoS and the pool will not be created in that case
## Impact

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L459-L466
```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < managersLength;) {
            address manager = _managers[i];
            if (manager == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

            _grantRole(POOL_MANAGER_ROLE, manager);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```
## Tool used
