# Allo#_fundPool
A `percentFee` amount is charged when funding a pool. However, the fee can be circumvented if the pool is using a low-decimals token and we fund the pool with a small amount. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's see the code of the `_fundPool` function:
```solidity
function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```
The `feeAmount` is calculated as follows:
```solidity
feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
```
where `getFeeDenominator` returns `1e18` and `percentFee` is represented like that: 1e18 = 100%, 1e17 = 10%, 1e16 = 1%, 1e15 = 0.1% (from the comments when declaring the variable).

Let's say the pool uses a token like [GeminiUSD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x056Fd409E1d7A124BD7017459dFEa2F387b6d5Cd) which is a token with 300M+ market cap, so it's widely used, and `percentFee` == 1e15 (0.1%)

A user could circumvent the fee by depositing a relatively small amount. In our example, he can deposit 9 GeminiUSD. In that case, the calculation will be:
`feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator() = (9e2 * 1e15) / 1e18 = 9e17/1e18 = 9/10 = 0;`

So the user ends up paying no fee. There is nothing stopping the user from funding his pool by invoking the `fundPool` with such a small amount as many times as he needs to fund the pool with whatever amount he chooses, circumventing the fee. 

Especially with the low gas fees on L2s on which the protocol will be deployed, this will be a viable method to fund a pool without paying any fee to the protocol. 
## Impact
The protocol doesn't collect fees from pools with low decimal tokens.

## Recommendation
Add a `minFundAmount` variable and check for it when funding a pool.
