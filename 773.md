# Pools will fail to handle fee-on-transfer token accounting  accurately
## Summary
Pools will fail to handle fee-on-transfer tokens accurately . Fee-on-transfer tokens deducts a fee while transferring . That's why actual amount received is smaller than amount sent . 
However , `BaseStrategy.sol` fails to handle the accounting properly . 

## Vulnerability Detail
 Increased `poolAmount ` amount will be greater than the actual pool amount . This will cause accounting issues . 
```solidity 
function increasePoolAmount(uint256 _amount) external override onlyAllo {
        _beforeIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
        poolAmount += _amount;
        _afterIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
    }
```
