# Allo user is forced to supply more Eth than necessary but it's not credited back the remainder
The current implementation of `Allo.sol` doesn't allow to create and fund a pool with `Native` token where `baseFee` + `amount` is exactly `msg.value` - this forces the user to always transfer more `msg.value` than intended but doesn't credit back the excess. Usually supplying more `msg.value` than needed is considered a user mistake, however, in this case the user is required to do so but doesn't receive the excess back which is a valid loss of funds for the user & could also break integrations of other systems / contracts with the Allo pool creation. 
## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `_createPool(...)` we have the following check (displayed in the code snippet below). Assume that we want to create and fund a pool with the `Native` token for `amount=X` and a `baseFee=Y` - from the `if` statement below you can see that if `baseFee + _amount >= msg.value` we will have a revert, this implies that `msg.value` must always be greater than `X + Y`, therefore, for a successful creation of a pool the user must always overpay in `msg.value`, however, the excess of `msg.value` is never credited back to the user and causes an unnecessary loss of funds. 
```solidity
function _createPool(
        bytes32 _profileId,
        IStrategy _strategy,
        bytes memory _initStrategyData,
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        Metadata memory _metadata,
        address[] memory _managers
    ) internal returns (uint256 poolId) {

        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }

        if (_amount > 0) {
            _fundPool(_amount, poolId, _strategy);
        }

        emit PoolCreated(poolId, _profileId, _strategy, _token, _amount, _metadata);
    }
```
## Impact
Unnecessary loss of funds. This issue can make Allo difficult to integrate with.

## Recommendation
Rework the if statement to:
```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
        revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
  }
```
