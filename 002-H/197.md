# Lack of access control for setPoolActive function
## Summary

[RFPSimpleStrategy.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol) contains a function that can be used to change the internal variable `poolActive` that is tied to `onlyActivePool` and `onlyInactivePool` modifiers. This function can be called by anyone disrupting the expected flow of the strategy.

## Vulnerability Detail

Throughout the strategy the following functions contain modifiers that check the status of `poolActive`:

`onlyActivePool` modifier: `_allocate` and `_registerRecipient` functions (with external functions in `BaseStrategy.sol`)
`onlyInactivePool` modifier: `_distribute` (with external function in `BaseStrategy.sol`) and `withdraw` functions

These 4 functions which represent the core of the strategy can be frontrun by a malicious party with  `setPoolActive(false)` or `setPoolActive(true)`  in order to block the funds going out of the contract and the core methods of the strategy.

## POC:

Paste this in `RFPSimpleStrategy.t.sol`:

```javascript
    function test_grief_withdraw() public {
        allo().fundPool{value: 1e18}(poolId, 1e18);
        vm.startPrank(pool_admin());
        strategy.setPoolActive(false);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(address(1337)); //fresh address no access privileges
        strategy.setPoolActive(true);
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(pool_admin());
        vm.expectRevert(POOL_ACTIVE.selector);
        strategy.withdraw(9.9e17); // 1e18 - 1e17 fee = 9.9e17
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```

## Impact

Given that this protocol should work on `All EVM compatible chains + Zkync Era` a Malicious party can perform a DDOS by changing the `poolActive` variable to always fail the `onlyActivePool` / `onlyInactivePool` modifier condition. 

The cost of the operation will be next to nothing on chains with cheap transaction costs. 
Funds will be stuck in the contract because all the distribution/withdraw methods will be grieved.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Given that the natspec contains the following `/// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool.` my recommendation is doing exactly that. Use the `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` modifier to restrict access to `setPoolActive` function.
