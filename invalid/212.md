# PoolManager in RFPSimpleStrategy.sol can withdraw funds in anytime
PoolManager can withdraw funds from pool anytime, which is against the document

## Vulnerability Detail
In https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/allo/flow-of-funds, it is said that:

    Once a pool has been funded, there is no way to withdraw funds from the pool other than to distribute them through the allocation strategy.
But in SFPSimpleStrategy.sol, PoolManager can withdraw funds at any time:

    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) onlyInactivePool {
        // Decrement the pool amount
        poolAmount -= _amount;

        // Transfer the amount to the pool manager
        _transferAmount(allo.getPool(poolId).token, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
The `onlyInactivePool` modifier can be bypassed easily by set Pool to inactive by using `RFPSimpleStrategy#setPoolActive` function

## Impact
Code is not same as the document

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only allow poolManager to withdraw when all milestones end
