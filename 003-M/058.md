# QVSimpleStrategy allows allocator to use as many votes as he wishes
QVSimpleStrategy allows allocator to use as many votes as he wishes
## Vulnerability Detail
`QVSimpleStrategy._allocate` function is called by allocator to vote for the recipient.
In order to track how many votes allocator already used, `allocator.voiceCredits` variable is used. It's needed to check [if user still has votes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L121) that he can use. 

The problem is that this variable is never set in the code. As result, allocator can vote as many times as he wishes. The only condition is [to use not more than `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L150C68-L150C95) for one call.
## Impact
Voting is messed up.

## Recommendation
Set `allocator.voiceCredits` inside `_qv_allocate` function.
