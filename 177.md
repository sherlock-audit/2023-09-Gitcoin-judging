# The `distribute` function in `RFPSimpleStrategy` cannot be executed multiple times.
## Summary
The `distribute` function in `RFPSimpleStrategy` cannot be executed multiple times so the milestones cannot be fully executed.
## Vulnerability Detail

In `RFPSimpleStrategy._distribute`, the `poolAmount` decreases with each execution and the expected asset transfer amount is `(recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18`, but it consistently requires that `recipient.proposalBid <= poolAmount`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L431-L439
```solidity
        // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
        if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();

        // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
        uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;

        // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
        poolAmount -= amount;
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
```

Assuming there is a proposal with a bid of 10 ETH, and it has two milestones, each with a `milestone.amountPercentage` of 50%, and the current `poolAmount` is also exactly 10 ETH. 

After the first execution, the `poolAmount` becomes 10 * (1 - 50%) = 5, which is still sufficient to satisfy the next milestone. However, the requirement `recipient.proposalBid <= poolAmount` prevents the second `distribute` from being executed.
## Impact
The `distribute` function in `RFPSimpleStrategy` cannot be executed multiple times so the milestones cannot be fully executed.

## Recommendation
Compare the value of `poolAmount` with `(recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18`.
