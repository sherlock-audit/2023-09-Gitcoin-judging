# Protocol accounts incorrect amount in the distribution strategy for fee on transfer tokens
Protocol accounts incorrect amount in the distribution strategy for fee on transfer tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

Whenever fund send to pool while creating the pool or after creating pool it transfer the funds into `strategy` and update the balance via `_strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee)` at Line Number [517](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L517).

it works perfectly for the normal ERC20 tokens but if the token is fee on transfer token then it updates more than transfer tokens to the distribution strategy contract. which will give the accounting issue and break the pool functions at many places

A internal function `_fundPool()` is called whenever funds send  to the pool by `fundPool()` or during creating the pool
```solidity
File: contracts/core/Allo.sol
502    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);//@audit-issue more than transfer tokens has been incremented

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
520    }
```

As fee on transfer tokens deducts fee from the transferring amount so after deducting fees transfer amount will be less than `amountAfterFee` but in strategy contract more than transfer amount has been incremented 
## Impact
Distribution pool will have accountancy issue and there will less balance than it accounts. which can break many invariants for fee on transfer tokens.
Fee on transfer tokens has been implemented perfectly

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check balance before  and after transferring tokens and then update the balance with actual `after-before` not with `amountAfterFee` and check other places where transferring tokens update incorrect balance for fee on transfer tokens
