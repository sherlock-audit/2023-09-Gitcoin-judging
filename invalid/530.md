# Users have to pay bigger fees than the `baseFee` amount
Users have to pay bigger fees than the `baseFee` amount.
## Vulnerability Detail
In Allo.sol when a user creates a pool, a base fee of ETH must be paid. Currently in order to check whether the user, creating the pool, has sent enough funds the following check is made: 
```solidity
(_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)
```
Therefore the msg.value that the user sends must be more than the `baseFee` required by the protocol.
## Impact
The issue will not be an extreme financial problem for the user, as they would need to just send one more Wei, but would cause an inconvenience where the `createPool` function would fail even if the caller has provided the exact amount of base fees required by the protocol.

```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
    revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `>` instead of `>=`  when checking whether the user, creating the pool, has sent enough funds.
