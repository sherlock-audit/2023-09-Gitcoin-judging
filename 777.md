# Unprotected external setPoolActive function allows anyone to manipulate the state of the pool
## Summary
The fact that anyone can set the state of the pool to active or inactive allows an attacker to manipulate the state of any pool in order to be able to call functions in circumstances he shouldn't be able to. Even the inline comment says: " 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event."

## Impact
Anyone can manipulate the active state of any pool

    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
