# [MEDIUM] QVBaseStrategy.sol - QVBaseStrategy is missing a `receive()` or a `fallback()` function in order to receive ETH
## Summary

The **`QVBaseStrategy.sol`** smart contract lacks a **`receive()`** or **`fallback()`** function, making it unable to accept incoming native tokens (e.g., ETH on Ethereum, MATIC on Polygon).

## Vulnerability Detail

Pools on the Allo ecosystem should be able to receive ERC20 tokens as well as **native tokens**, which will later be used in order to allocate and distribute in accordance with the attached strategy. 

At the present moment, the **`QVBaseStrategy.sol`** lacks a **`receive()`** or **`fallback()`** which means that it will revert when the **`_transferAmountFrom`** is called from ****************`Allo.sol`****************.

## Impact

Users utilizing the **`QVBaseStrategy.sol`**  the **`QVSimpleStrategy.sol`** , or any strategy inheriting those mentioned above cannot use native tokens in their implementation, which seems to be an unintended bug.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To allow the contract to accept native tokens on any EVM-compatible network, add a **`receive()`** function if the sole intention is to handle straightforward native token transfers. The function should be **`external`** and **`payable`**:
