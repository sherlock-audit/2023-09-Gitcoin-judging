# Anchor deployement can be always failed
Anchor deployement can be always failed

## Vulnerability Detail
constructor of Anchor is 
```solidity
File: contracts/core/Anchor.sol
 constructor(bytes32 _profileId) {
        registry = Registry(msg.sender);
        profileId = _profileId;
    }
```

it creates a new instance of Registry which needs to be initialize 
```solidity
File: contracts/core/Registry.sol
    function initialize(address _owner) external reinitializer(1) {
        // Make sure the owner is not 'address(0)'
        if (_owner == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

        // Grant the role to the owner
        _grantRole(ALLO_OWNER, _owner);
    }

```
https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L79

At new instance Attacker can call this function just after the deployment of Anchor and set owner role to any address. which will make overall deployment fail.  

This can lead to DOS as every time Attacker will make deployement fail

## Impact
DOS

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A best way to mitigate this issue will be deploying strategy(making a new instance) and initialize in same transaction so Attacker won't able to call initialize the function.
