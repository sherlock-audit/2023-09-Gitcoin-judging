# Admin can assign manager roles to invalid addresses during pool creation
## Summary
Admin can mistakenly assign manager roles to an extruder who is not a member of a profile
## Vulnerability Detail
 During pool creation, the manager addresses passed into the _createPool function are not crosschecked to asses if they are a member of a profile before assigning manager roles to them.
 If an admin whether intentionally, mistakenly or randomly adds wrong addresses as manager roles. Although "registry.isOwnerOrMemberOfProfile" was called initially during pool creation to confirm profile owner. It was is not used to assess if addresses are valid and part of a profile. Thereby allowing extruder addresses to gain managerial roles and manipulate contract by causing denial of service attacks to recipients and causing  managerial errors detrimental to normal functioning of the contract.

## Code Snippet
`
 function _createPool(
        bytes32 _profileId,
        IStrategy _strategy,
        bytes memory _initStrategyData,
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        Metadata memory _metadata,
        address[] memory _managers
    ) internal returns (uint256 poolId) {
        if (!registry.isOwnerOrMemberOfProfile(_profileId, msg.sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();

        poolId = ++_poolIndex;

        // Generate the manager & admin roles for the pool (this is the way we do this throughout the protocol for consistency)
        bytes32 POOL_MANAGER_ROLE = bytes32(poolId);
        bytes32 POOL_ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(poolId, "admin"));`

`  // grant pool managers roles
        uint256 managersLength = _managers.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < managersLength;) {
            address manager = _managers[i];
            if (manager == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

            _grantRole(POOL_MANAGER_ROLE, manager);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
the isOwnerOrMemberOfProfile function from the registry contract should be utilized again during  pool creation to ascertain if manager addresses are valid addresses.
