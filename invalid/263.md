# Loss of precision can result in tokens being permanently stuck in the contract
Due to precision loss during the calculation of the amount, extra tokens can become permanently stuck in the QVBaseStrategy contract。
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L571
Assume totalRecipientVotes is 100000, we have 3 users, their vote counts are 123, 345 and 99421, this is my test case:
```solidity
    function test_poolAmountlossPrecision() public {
        uint256 poolAmount = 1e18;

        uint256 totalRecipientVotes = 100000;

        uint256 amount1 = poolAmount * 123 / totalRecipientVotes;

        uint256 amount2 = poolAmount * 345 / totalRecipientVotes;

        uint256 amount3 = poolAmount * 99421 / totalRecipientVotes;

        uint256 total = amount1+amount2+amount3;
        
        assert(poolAmount > total);
    }
```

We can observe that the actual tokens used are less than poolAmount due to precision loss. Please note that the larger the totalRecipientVotes, the greater the deviation, and the participation of more users also leads to a larger deviation. Therefore, the final deviation amount should be significant. Additionally, I've noticed that there is no 'withdraw extra token' function provided in the contract。

## Impact
The poolManager is unable to withdraw these extra tokens
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (PayoutSummary memory)
    {
        Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];

        // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
        uint256 amount;
        if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
            amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes; //@audit lost precision result in token stuck in contract but not provide a withdraw function.
        }
        return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
we should provide withdraw function to retrieve extra tokens, and we also need to reduce precision loss
