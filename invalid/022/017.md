# The `createPool` function is missing a refund for excess native tokens.
## Summary
The `createPool` function is missing a refund for excess native tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `createPool` function, native tokens are transferred based on the `baseFee`. The function only requires that there are enough native tokens, but it doesn't handle any excess native tokens

```solidity
        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }

        if (_amount > 0) {
            _fundPool(_amount, poolId, _strategy);
        }
```

Since `baseFee` is changeable by the owner, the following situation could occur:
1. The user calculates based on the current `baseFee` and sets `msg.value` accordingly.
2. Before the user's transaction is executed, the owner changes the `baseFee` to lower value in the same block.
3. The user's transaction is executed, and after paying the `baseFee`, there is a surplus in `msg.value` that is not refunded to the user.

From the user's perspective, he hasn't made a wrong input. This situation resembles a non-malicious front-running scenario, which ultimately results in additional costs for the user.
## Impact
The excess native token paid by the user is not refunded.
