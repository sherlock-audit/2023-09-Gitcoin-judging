# Anyone can claim on behalf of others in the `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy::claim()`
## Summary
`DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy::claim()` is an external function and anyone can initiate the claim process. But the issue is that the `msg.sender` and the recipient is never checked. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` uses a pull method instead of a push method, which means the funds are not directly transferred to the `recipientAddress`. It is only transferred when the user claims their funds.

`claim()` function is an external function as expected, because people should be able to call this function and claim their tokens. However, the caller of the `claim()` function is never validated. Bob can claim on behalf of Alice.

    function claim(Claim[] calldata _claims) external nonReentrant onlyAfterAllocation {
        uint256 claimsLength = _claims.length;

        // Loop through the claims
        for (uint256 i; i < claimsLength;) {
            Claim memory singleClaim = _claims[i];
            Recipient memory recipient = _recipients[singleClaim.recipientId];
            uint256 amount = claims[singleClaim.recipientId][singleClaim.token];

            // If the claim amount is zero this will revert
            if (amount == 0) {
                revert INVALID();
            }

            /// Delete the claim from the mapping
            delete claims[singleClaim.recipientId][singleClaim.token];

            address token = singleClaim.token;

            // Transfer the tokens to the recipient
            _transferAmount(token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

            // Emit that the tokens have been claimed and sent to the recipient
            emit Claimed(singleClaim.recipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, token);
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

As you can see above there is no check in terms of `msg.sender` in this function.

There are a few things to mention here. Funds are not transferred to the `msg.sender`, they are sent to the `recipientAddress` of the `Claim`. So this is not a direct stealing of the funds, they are still going to the expected address. But the issue here is timing.

There might be tons of different scenarios where the actual owner of the `recipientAddress` doesn't want to claim at the moment. Maybe they lost access to the address. Maybe that address got blacklisted or compromised. Maybe they just don't want to claim right now.

I considered this issue as a medium vulnerability since the funds are not directly stolen, but can be transferred by anyone on behalf of someone else without the owner's consent/intention

## Impact
Anyone can initiate a claim process on behalf of someone else.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would recommend adding a check to validate if the caller is actually the recipient.
