# Can not create profile and update profile on zkSync network
## Summary
Can not create profile and update profile on zkSync network because of different behaviors from EVM instructions between zkSync and Ethereum

## Vulnerability Detail
In creating profile flow, anchors are generated for users through logics in function `Registry::_generateAnchor()`. In updating profile, logics in `Registry::_generateAnchor()` is also triggered given user's new `_name`.
Function `Registry::_generateAnchor()` deploys anchors using `CREATE3::deploy()` logics, which uses `create2` to deploy deterministic contracts. The function also returns anchor address if it is already existed, which is precalculated address using `CREATE3.getDeployed(salt)`
However, both 2 above flows will not work properly:
1. Creation code is constructed in run-time and the zksolc compiler is not aware of it beforehand. This will cause this deployment fails. Reference from [zksync docs](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/architecture/differences-with-ethereum.html#evm-instructions)
2. [Address derivation on zksync is different from Ethereum](https://era.zksync.io/docs/reference/architecture/differences-with-ethereum.html#address-derivation), which will return addresses that is not deployed Anchor contracts

PoC:
Try using `create3Deploy` function from [this contract ](https://goerli.explorer.zksync.io/address/0x61cD7B479dcF642B120185C80D62a78a7Ab47842#contract). It will get failed
## Impact
Protocol will not work as expected on zksync era network: can not create profiles for users

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using Factory contract pattern: deploy Anchor contracts through a Factory contract
