# _fundPool / BaseStrategy doesn't properly support feeOnTransfer tokens
## Summary

Because `_fundPool` in `Allo.sol` calls ` _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);` which incorrectly updates the `poolAmount` for fee on transfer tokens, distributions can be messed up. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`_fundPool` in `Allo.sol` calls ` _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);`

This function increases the `poolAmount` in the strategy by `amountAfterFee`. However, in the case of fee-on-transfer tokens this is incorrect -- the `poolAmount` should increase by something smaller than `amountAfterFee` (since the strategy will receive less tokens than `amountAfterFee`). 

All strategies that derive from `BaseStrategy` will have messed up distributions due to this. As an example, in QVBaseStrategy, the amount of distribution is calculated with this formula:

`amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;`

Consider the case where we are trying to pay out all recipients with the fee on transfer token -- because `poolAmount` is higher than the amount of the token we have in the first place, we will attempt to transfer out more of the token than we actually can, which can cause it to revert. If `distribute` is called on the strategy with an individual recipient id, the individual recipient will get more than they are supposed to -- for example, if a participant is supposed to get 50% of the strategy contract's allocation, they will get 50% of `poolAmount`, which is higher than 50% of the strategy contract's token balance and thus incorrect. This will lead to reverts when trying to distribute to some of the later recipients, because the strategy contract just doesn't have enough funds. 

## Impact

Distributions will be incorrect (and potentially revert in some cases).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of having a `increasePoolAmount` function, just have a `updatePoolAmount` function that updates the `poolAmount` by checking the strategy contract's balance of the pool's ERC20 token.
