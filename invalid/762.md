# In QVSimpleStrategy.sol, allocator.voiceCredits is never decreased
The allocation system uses voiceCredits to keep track of the remaining credits in order to vote. This should decrease every time you vote, if it's == 0 you should not be able to vote. 
voiceCredits  is never decreased.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L107-L124
Calling allocate, `_hasVoiceCreditsLeft` (view function) checks if you have any credits left. If this == 0 it reverts.

We can see that in `_qv_allocate`, it's also never decreased:

## Impact
In whatever scenario, it's possible to use more credits than originally allocated to the allocator. This makes  `_hasVoiceCreditsLeft` useless since it always returns true.

## Recommendation
In `_allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender)`, decrease `allocator.voiceCredits` by `voiceCreditsToAllocate`
