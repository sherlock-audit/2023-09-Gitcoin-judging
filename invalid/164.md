# Discrepancy in `_fundPool` fee calculations allowing possible misappropriation of funds due to absence of consistency check between `_amount`, `feeAmount`, and `amountAfterFee`
## Summary

An attacker can drain funds from the `Allo.sol` contract by exploiting the fee mechanism in the `_fundPool` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract is derived from multiple other contracts and libraries such as `Ownable`, `AccessControl`, `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`, among others. The purpose of this contract appears to be to manage various investment pools and their associated strategies. These pools can be funded, allocated, and distributed based on the specific strategies.

A key function of interest is `_fundPool`, which takes an `_amount`, a `_poolId`, and a `strategy` as parameters. This function is responsible for calculating the fee and subsequently transferring the appropriate amounts to the correct destinations.

### The flaw

> The vulnerability arises within the `_fundPool` function's fee calculation logic:

```solidity
if (percentFee > 0) {
 feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
 amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

 _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
}
```

The code calculates `feeAmount` based on the inputted `_amount` and a defined `percentFee`, but notably lacks any verification to ensure the total funds (i.e., the sum of `feeAmount` and `amountAfterFee`) correspond with the initial `_amount`.

Solidity's integer division truncates any remainder, so when the calculation for `feeAmount` is performed, **any discrepancy caused by the truncation is not accounted for. This allows for situations where the sum of the `feeAmount` and the `amountAfterFee` could possibly be less than the original `_amount`, which would mean more funds than necessary could be transferred, exposing the contract to possible fund misappropriations**.

In other words, the absence of a check after fee calculation is the root cause, and the code does not guarantee that `amountAfterFee + feeAmount = _amount`. This is what makes the attack vector viable.

Furthermore, the use of the `nonReentrant` modifier in the external `fundPool` (which is calling the internal `_fundPool`) would prevent reentrancy attacks. However, it is worth to note that this vulnerability **does not rely on reentrancy**. An attacker could still exploit the described vulnerability by making **individual, separate** calls to the `fundPool` function.

An attacker can leverage this vulnerability by choosing specific `_amount` values for which the truncation discrepancy is maximized. The attacker would then fund the pool repeatedly with these specifically chosen values, slowly draining more funds from the contract than intended.

## Impact

An attacker, with enough gas, can repeatedly fund a pool with carefully chosen amounts to drain the contract's funds over time.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function fundPool(uint256 _poolId, uint256 _amount) external payable nonReentrant {
        // if amount is 0, revert with 'NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS()' error
        if (_amount == 0) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();

        // Call the internal fundPool() function
        _fundPool(_amount, _poolId, pools[_poolId].strategy);
    }

    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual review.

## Recommendation

1. Implement a verification step after the fee calculation within the `_fundPool` function:

> ```solidity
> require(_amount == feeAmount + amountAfterFee, "Invalid amount calculations");
> ```

This check ensures that the sum of `feeAmount` and `amountAfterFee` always corresponds to the initial `_amount`, effectively safeguarding against unintended transfers.

2. Alternatively, consider using a more precise method of fee calculation or incorporating rounding mechanisms that can account for the discrepancy caused by truncation, ensuring that the correct amount is always transferred.

## POC

The idea here is to maximize the amount that is "left out" when calculating `feeAmount`. The feeAmount is calculated as follows:

```solidity
feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
```

If `_amount * percentFee` is not a multiple of `getFeeDenominator()`, the Solidity division will truncate the result, causing a small amount of value to be lost. This is the amount we wish to maximize to exploit the contract optimally.

The maximum discrepancy is introduced when `_amount * percentFee` is one less than a multiple of `getFeeDenominator()`. In mathematical terms:

```plaintext
(_amount * percentFee) % getFeeDenominator() = getFeeDenominator() - 1
```

Solving for `_amount` gives us:

```plaintext
_amount = ((getFeeDenominator() - 1) + (getFeeDenominator() * n)) / percentFee
```

Here, `n` is any non-negative integer. The choice of `n` would depend on how much `_amount` you can invest.

**One could create a loop that calculates the optimal value of `n` iteratively, ensuring that the discrepancy is exploited to its maximum**.

```javascript
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
// Initialize and deploy contracts
const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
console.log("Deploying contracts with the account:", deployer.address);

// Assume other required contracts are deployed, such as registry, etc.
const REGISTRY_ADDRESS = "0xRegistryAddress";
const STRATEGY_ADDRESS = "0xStrategyAddress";
const TOKEN_ADDRESS = "0xTokenAddress";

const Allo = await ethers.getContractFactory("Allo");
const allo = await Allo.deploy(REGISTRY_ADDRESS, deployer.address);  // Treasuring being the deployer for example
await allo.deployed();

// Fetch percentFee and baseFee from the deployed contract
const percentFee = await allo.percentFee();
const baseFee = await allo.baseFee();

// Create a pool
const PROFILE_ID = ethers.utils.formatBytes32String("exampleProfile");
const INIT_STRATEGY_DATA = ethers.utils.toUtf8Bytes("exampleData");
const METADATA = {
    name: "example pool",
    description: "example description",
    extra: "Any extra data we want to declare"
};
const MANAGERS = [deployer.address];

const poolId = await allo.createPool(
    PROFILE_ID,
    STRATEGY_ADDRESS,
    INIT_STRATEGY_DATA,
    TOKEN_ADDRESS,
    baseFee, // Using baseFee as an example amount
    METADATA,
    MANAGERS
);

// Determine the fee structure
const feeDenominator = await allo.getFeeDenominator();

// Craft the amount to exploit the fee discrepancy
const MAX_ITERATIONS = 100;  // Arbitrarily chosen. Adjust as needed.

for (let i = 0; i < MAX_ITERATIONS; i++) {
    const chosenAmount = ((feeDenominator.sub(1)).add(feeDenominator.mul(i))).div(percentFee);

    await allo.fundPool(poolId, chosenAmount);

    // Now, let's check the discrepancy
    const strategyAddress = (await allo.pools(poolId)).strategy;
    const strategyBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(strategyAddress);
    const expectedBalance = chosenAmount.sub((chosenAmount.mul(percentFee)).div(feeDenominator));

    console.log(`Iteration ${i}`);
    console.log("Expected balance in strategy:", expectedBalance.toString());
    console.log("Actual balance in strategy:", strategyBalance.toString());

    if(!expectedBalance.eq(strategyBalance)) {
        console.error("Discrepancy found in iteration ", i);
    }
}

main().catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
});
```

> In this script:

1. We start by setting up the environment.
2. We fetch the `feeDenominator` and `percentFee` from the contract itself.
3. A formula is used to calculate `chosenAmount` that maximizes the discrepancy due to Solidity's truncating division. This `chosenAmount` will be used to fund the pool.
4. We repeatedly fund the pool with the `chosenAmount` and then check the strategy's balance.
5. The actual balance in the strategy and the expected balance are then compared. If they don't match, it confirms the vulnerability.

The script leverages the flaw by calculating an `_amount` which maximizes the truncation discrepancy:

```plaintext
(_amount * percentFee) % getFeeDenominator() = getFeeDenominator() - 1
```

By carefully choosing `MAX_ITERATIONS` (`n` times) and executing this repeatedly using different values of `n`, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to the maximum extent, thus eventually draining the contract.
