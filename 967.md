# Admin or Member Can Inflate Pool Amount
## Summary
There is a possibility for a re-entrant call to recall an increase in pool amount multiple times
## Vulnerability Detail

The details are as follows:
- A malicious owner creates a profile with some members
- A malicious owner create a pool with a new strategy using the `createPoolWithCustomStrategy`  with malicious contracts posing as token and strategy contract, the malicious strategy contract must have similar features to the real contract
- On the _fundAmount function being called in the create flow, it calls on the `transferFrom` from the token
- Then it calls on the _strategy.increasePoolAmount, this will call the malicious contract which in turn send delegatecall to any real live strategy (this is to impersonate the Allo contract) and inflate the pool value to excessive amounts unchecked without the pool being able to redeem these values.
- The malicious members can then allocate these funds to random strangers or compromised individuals.
- These members or individuals can withdraw tokens

## Impact
High Impact, which in best case scenario is loss of data and DOS, which could cause users or admin to switch pools. Worst case scenario loss of funds.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L144

```solidity
function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
    
function allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) external payable onlyAllo onlyInitialized {
        _beforeAllocate(_data, _sender);
        _allocate(_data, _sender);
        _afterAllocate(_data, _sender);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Move non-reentrant checks to internal functions instead and add checks in the increasePoolAmount
