# The calculation of feeAmount is not reasonable.
## Summary
The calculation of feeAmount is not reasonable.

## Vulnerability Detail
The more funds a user provides to the pool, the higher the feeAmount will be. Conversely, providing a small amount of funds may result in a very small or even close to zero feeAmount.

## Impact
It is unfair to users who provide a large amount of funds compared to those who provide a small amount of funds.
