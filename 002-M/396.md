# Insufficient support for Fee-on-Transfer Tokens which will result in computation inconsistencies.
Fee-on-Transfer Tokens are not handled well which will result in computation inconsistencies.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the [docs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/tree/main#q-are-there-any-fee-on-transfer-tokens-interacting-with-the-smart-contracts), fee-on-transfer tokens will interact with the protocol but they are not well handled which will result in wrong calculation.

[Fee-on-Transfer Tokens](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer) take a transfer fee. This means the actual received amount is not equal to the input amount from the user.

The `_fundPool(_amount,,)` takes `_amount` input from the user, then that `_amount` is used to calculate the `amountAfterFee`, which is then used to `increasePoolAmount()` of the pool. 
```solidity
    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;
        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;
            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        ///@audit-issue M fee-on-transfer tokens not handled
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```

That is not correct. The actual received amount will not be equal to the inputted `_amount` in the case of a fee-on-transfer token like PAXG.  The calculation should be done on the basis of the actual amount received. And then that will be used to `increasePoolAmount()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Do the calculation on the actual received amount by calculating the `before` and `after` amounts of the contract
```solidity
    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(this), amount: _amount}));
        uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20Upgradeable(_token).balanceOf(address(this));

        ///@note Actual Recieved Amount
        uint256 amountAfterFee = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
        require(amountAfterFee != 0, "NOT ENOUGH TOKENS SENT");


        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            /// ( * ) / 1e18
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmount(_token, treasury, feeAmount);
        }

        //@note As the contract has already recieved all the tokens so it will be a `_transferAmount` & not `_transferAmountFrom`
        _transferAmount(_token, address(_strategy), amountAfterFee);
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```
This refactored code properly handles fee-on-transfer tokens by calculating the fee based on the actual received amount. Thanks!
