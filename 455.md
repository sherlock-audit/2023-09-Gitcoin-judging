# Use Ownbale2Step as Ownable can result in loss/compromise of ownership
## Summary
Not using Ownable2Step 

## Vulnerability Detail
Ownable contracts have a single step change of ownership as opposed to two step change of Ownable2Step

## Impact
Single step change ownership can lead to loss of ownership for the Allo Contracts if ownership passed to incorrect address, or address that has lost control or access private keys etc implying critical functionality depending on owner is lost to the contracts  e.g updating registry, updating fee percent, adding/removing strategies, recovering funds etc
