# [M-01] Anyone can toggle `RFPSimpleStrategy:setPoolActive` and halt fund distribution and participant registration
## Summary

Anyone can toggle `RFPSimpleStrategy:setPoolActive` and halt fund distribution and registration.  The `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` modifier should be added to the function.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `RFPSimpleStrategy`, fund allocation, withdrawal and distribution, as well as participant registry depend on `onlyActivePool` and `onlyInactivePool` modifiers.

Pool active status should be determined by the pool manager, however curently, anyone can toggle the pool active status via `RFPSimpleStrategy::setPoolActive`.

## Impact

This presents a cheap and simple griefing vector that an attacker can use to halt registry, fund allocations, withdrawals and distributions.

## Code Snippet

Code snippet:

``` solidity
    /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```

Add this test to `RFPSimpleStrategy.t.sol` to verify:

``` solidity
    function test_pool_toggle() public {
        allo().fundPool{value: 1e18}(poolId, 1e18);
        address random = vm.addr(0x12345);
        vm.startPrank(random);
        strategy.setPoolActive(false);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation

Add the `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` modifier to `setPoolActive()`.

``` solidity
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
