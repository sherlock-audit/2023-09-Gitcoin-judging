# Anyone can Set the Active Status of the Strategy Pool because the `onlyPoolManager()` Modifier is Missing
## Summary
The current issue with the strategy Pool is that there is a missing security measure called the `onlyPoolManager()` modifier on the `setPoolActive()` function. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The [`RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219) function is meant to control the active or inactive status of the `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` Pool. Ideally & as per the code comments, it should only be accessible to the designated pool manager, but it lacks an access control modifier. Consequently, anyone can invoke this function and modify the pool's status. This vulnerability is concerning because many other functions rely on the `onlyActivePool` modifier.
```solidity
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    ///@audit-issue H Access Control Missing
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
``` 

## Impact
- Access Control Missing

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to add the `onlyPoolManager()` modifier to the `setPoolActive()` function as follows:
```solidity
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
