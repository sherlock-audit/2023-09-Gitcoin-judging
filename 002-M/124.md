# Incorrect accounting for claims in `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` for fee-on-transfer tokens
## Summary
Incorrect accounting for claims in `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` for fee-on-transfer tokens results in recipients being able to claim more than the token amount allocated to them.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contest README explicitly states that pools may interact with fee-on-transfer tokens, so they may be added to the allow list for `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy`.  In the `_afterAllocate` hook, the amount claimable by the recipient allocated to is increased by the amount transferred to the strategy rather than the received amount (which will be lower for fee-on-transfer tokens).

```solidity
        claims[recipientId][token] += amount;
```
The whole amount recorded in the `claims` mapping is transferred to the specified recipient when `claim` is called. Amounts received by recipients will be inflated, and the strategy will have insufficient funds to satisfy all claims, locking funds.

It should be noted that `withdraw` only allows recovery of `pool.token` which does not include all allowed tokens for allocation.

## Impact
Inflated claim amounts for recipients and locked funds due to insufficient token balance in the strategy.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider increasing the claim amount by the difference between the token balance before and after.
