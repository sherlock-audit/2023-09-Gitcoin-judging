# `percentFee` would not work properly with token decimals != 18
In the `Allo.sol` smart contract, `percentFee` assumes to work with only 18 decimals tokens. As it is how the docs and codes show:

> This variable holds the fee percentage applied to transactions within pools. It's represented as a fraction of 1e18, where 1e18 equals 100%.

```solidity
    /// @notice Getter for the fee denominator
    /// @return FEE_DENOMINATOR The fee denominator is (1e18) which represents 100%
    function getFeeDenominator() public pure returns (uint256 FEE_DENOMINATOR) {
        return 1e18; 
    }
```
And it's used in several functions related with `_fundPool`. However, since Allo supports all ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, we need to consider tokens with decimals != 18. And current implementation will result in users can bypass the `percentFee` using lower decimal tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail

Assume we create the pool or fund it with 10USDC which has 6 decimals, the `percentFee` is set to 1e10 and the `getFeeDenominator` will always return 1e18. Then:`10 * 1e6 *1e10 / 1e18 = 1e17/1e18 = 0`  The `percentFee` is bypassed by splitting the funding into small amounts and choosing lower decimal tokens ( e.g. [Gemini USD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x056Fd409E1d7A124BD7017459dFEa2F387b6d5Cd?a=0x5f65f7b609678448494De4C87521CdF6cEf1e932) only have 2 decimals.)
## Impact
It will result in improper calculation of `percentFee` and loss of the markets.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
 /// @notice Fund a pool.
    /// @dev Deducts the fee and transfers the amount to the distribution strategy.
    ///      Emits a 'PoolFunded' event.
    /// @param _amount The amount to transfer
    /// @param _poolId The 'poolId' for the pool you are funding
    /// @param _strategy The address of the strategy
    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check the specific token decimals and implement the feeDenominator accordingly, alternatively, supports only tokens with decimals = 18.
