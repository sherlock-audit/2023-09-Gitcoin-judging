# The protocol cannot use transfer-on-fee token as pool.token
## Summary

As we all know, transfer-on-fee tokens will charge a fee for each transfer. According to readme, we can know that the protocol supports such tokens. However, current implementations do not handle such tokens. For such tokens, obtaining the actual number of tokens received should be calculated using the `balanceAfter - balanceBefore` method.

## Vulnerability Detail

_fundPool is called by [[fundPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L344)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L344) and [[_createPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L481)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L481). This function is used to transfer the specified amount from the caller to the strategy contract bound to the pool.

```solidity
File: contracts\core\Allo.sol
502:     function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
503:         uint256 feeAmount;
504:         uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;
505: 
506:         Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
507:         address _token = pool.token;
......//
516:->       _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
517:->       _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);
518: 
519:         emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
520:     }

File: contracts\strategies\BaseStrategy.sol
153:     function increasePoolAmount(uint256 _amount) external override onlyAllo {
154:         _beforeIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
155:->       poolAmount += _amount;
156:         _afterIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
157:     }
```

L516, transfer `amountAfterFee` from the caller to _strategy.

L517, call `_strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee)` in order to accumulate `amountAfterFee` to `poolAmount`.

Since transfer-on-fee charges a fee in the transfer, the actual amount received by _strategy is less than `amountAfterFee`. However, the value accumulated to `poolAmount` is `amountAfterFee`, which causes `poolAmount` to be higher than the amount of tokens held by _strategy. In this way, a situation arises: when all amount of token is distributed to all recipients, the last recipient may not receive the token because _strategy does not have enough balance.

Consider the following scenario:

For simplicity, assume that pool.token is a transfer-on-fee token. Each transfer is charged a 1% fee. There are 2 recipients (A and B). percentFee=0.

1.  Someone transferred 1000e18 token via `fundPool`. Due to the 1% fee, the actual amount transferred to the strategy was 990e18. poolAmount = 1000e18.
2.  A and B should share `poolAmount` equally, which means that both A and B will get 500e18 token.
3.  The pool manager calls `distribute` for A, which internally calls token.transfer(A, 500e18), then A gets 495e18 token. And strategy currently holds 490e18 token.
4.  The pool manager calls `distribute` for B, which internally calls token.transfer(B, 500e18), then tx revert due to insufficient balance. B gets nothing.

There is another piece of code that is also affected: [[DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-distribution-vault/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol#L135)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-distribution-vault/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol#L135).

## Impact

Affected strategy contracts: All.

Because the real balance of transfer-on-fee tokens is not calculated correctly, the last recipient cannot get the funds it deserves. The number of affected recipients depends on the transfer fee. The higher the fee, the more recipients are affected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to use the following method to obtain the real amount:

```fix
uint256 balanceBefore = token.balance(strategy);
token.transfer(strategy, amount);
uint256 balanceAfter = token.balance(strategy);
uint256 realAmount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```
