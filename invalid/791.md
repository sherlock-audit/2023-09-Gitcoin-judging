# Absence of Withdraw Function in QVBaseStrategy

The QVBaseStrategy lacks a withdraw function, preventing the pool admin from retrieving stuck funds from the pool, which poses a financial risk.

## Vulnerability Detail

Typically, strategies have a `withdraw` function that enables pool admins to rescue funds if they become stuck in the pool. For example:

- In donation voting:

- In RFP strategy:

However, QVBaseStrategy notably lacks this crucial feature. Consequently, if an emergency occurs or if a user mistakenly contributes funds to the pool during the distribution phase, these funds will be irrevocably trapped.

## Impact

The absence of a withdraw function means that funds can become permanently stuck in the pool.

## Recommendation

Add a `withdraw` function to QVBaseStrategy to allow the pool admin to withdraw the pool amount in case there is funds stuck in the pool.
