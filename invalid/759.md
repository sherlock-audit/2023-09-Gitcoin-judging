# RFP Committee strategy allocation is not fair
## Summary
There is no enforced voting period in `RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol`
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_allocate()` function will save the first recipient that receives `voteThreshold` votes as the `acceptedRecipientId` which is unfair since in reality there might be another recipient that will receive more votes but requires more time for the allocators to vote. It is standard practice in all kinds of voting to have a voting period after which results are evaluated. 
## Impact
