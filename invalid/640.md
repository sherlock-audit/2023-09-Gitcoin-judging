# User cannot create a pool with a token that is not NATIVE due to incorrect parameters
`baseFee` is a flat fee that Allo charges for all pools on creation. But while sending the base fee to the treasury, incorrect token address is passed in `_transferAmount` thus failing to allow users to create pool that do not own eth. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`_createPool` is an internal function which is called by both `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` & `createPool`. During the creation of a pool a base fee is set which can be later updated by the owner of the contract. The base fee is sent to the treasury & appropriate checks are in place validating whether the token address is NATIVE or not & whether the user holds sufficient amount.

```solidity
File: Allo.sol

469    if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);      /// @audit
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
```
The problem is when `_transferAmount` is called to send the required base fee to the treasury. Instead of entering `_token` (the token address), `NATIVE` is passed as a parameter.

*`_transferAmount`  transfers an amount of a token to an address.* 

```solidity
File: Transfer.sol

   function _transferAmount(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
        if (_token == NATIVE) {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_to, _amount);
        } else {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, _to, _amount);
        }
    }
```
But since `NATIVE` is passed instead of `_token`, the function always executes the first IF condition which only transfers ETH. Thus if the token address is not the eth address, then the call will always fail.

```solidity
File: solady/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol

        /// @dev Sends `amount` (in wei) ETH to `to`.
    function safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
        assembly {
            if iszero(call(gas(), to, amount, gas(), 0x00, gas(), 0x00)) {
                mstore(0x00, 0xb12d13eb) // `ETHTransferFailed()`.
                revert(0x1c, 0x04)
            }
        }
    }
```
## Impact
User with or without strategy won't be able to create a pool if they don't hold any eth.

## Recommendation
Pass in `_token` instead of `NATIVE`.

```solidity
-               _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
+               _transferAmount(_token, treasury, baseFee);
```
