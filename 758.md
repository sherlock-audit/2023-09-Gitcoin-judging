# Funds stuck at the Allo contract could be stolen using fundPool() function
## Summary

Funds stuck at the Allo contract could be stolen using the `fundPool` function

## Vulnerability Detail

The `Allo#fundPool` function permits anyone to fund a chosen pool. When calling this function, the funder specifies the amount of the pool's tokens to be deposited into that strategy address. Concurrently, a portion of these funded tokens, determined by the `percentFee` variable, is sent to the treasury address.

However, a vulnerability arises if the pool token is ETH (designated as NATIVE). Contract would check if the current `msg.value` is larger or equal to the transferred amounts at lines 513 and 516, while it should be larger or equal to their sum. A malicious funder might declare a funding amount larger than the actual `msg.value` by the exact fee percentage. If this happens, funds that should only be retrievable by the owner through the `recoverFunds` function would be paid out as a fee. This means the malicious funder could actually steal stuck funds by covering their own fees with it.

## Impact

Funds stuck at the Allo contract could be stolen using the `fundPool` function and used for fee payment

```solidity
File: Allo.sol
339:     function fundPool(uint256 _poolId, uint256 _amount) public payable nonReentrant {
340:         // if amount is 0, revert with 'NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS()' error
341:         if (_amount == 0) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
342: 
343:         // Call the internal fundPool() function
344:         _fundPool(_amount, _poolId, pools[_poolId].strategy);
345:     }
...
502:     function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
503:         uint256 feeAmount;
504:         uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;
505: 
506:         Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
507:         address _token = pool.token;
508: 
509:         if (percentFee > 0) {
510:             feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
511:             amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;
512: 
513:             _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
514:         }
515: 
516:         _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee})); 
517:         _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);
518: 
519:         emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
520:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding to the `fundPool` function check that if the pool token is `ETH` (`NATIVE`) then the funding amount should be equal to the `msg.value`.
