# Creation of pool with Base Fee will fail with `NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS`
Creation of pool with Base Fee will fail with `NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS`, which breaks core contract functionality

## Vulnerability Detail
Checks to ensure enough native token to pay base fee (and possibly funding amount) are incorrectly written. Thus when the correct amount of native token is supplied the creation will fail and revert. Classified as medium because this issue breaks core contract functionality.

## Impact
Creation of pool with a baseFee will fail if the correct amount of ETH is included in the txn. It could be circumvented by supplying excess ETH to the contract.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
    revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change code to 
```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
    revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
}
```
