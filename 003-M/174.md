# Allocator can bypass `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` restriction

Because `allocator.voiceCredits` is never incremented by `voiceCreditsToAllocate`, an allocator can constantly allocate voice credits to a recipient without being stopped by the `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` restriction. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In QVSimpleStrategy.sol, here is the check to see if an allocator can allocate more voice credits:

`if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();`

```solidity
    function _hasVoiceCreditsLeft(uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate, uint256 _allocatedVoiceCredits)
        internal
        view
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        return _voiceCreditsToAllocate + _allocatedVoiceCredits <= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator;
    }
```

However, the issue is that `allocator.voiceCredits` is never incremented by `voiceCreditsToAllocate`, so as long as the `voiceCreditsToAllocate` passed in by the allocator is `<= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`, this check will pass even if it's done multiple times. Thus, the allocator can call the allocation function with `voiceCreditsToAllocate = maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` multiple times, thus allocating way more voice credits than allowed, and they will never be stopped. 

Same issue with not incrementing `allocator.voiceCredits` seems to occur in `QVGovernanceERC20Votes.sol` as well. 

## Impact

An allocator for `QVSimpleStrategy` or `QVGovernanceERC20Votes` can allocate as many voice credits as they want, even though they should only be able to allocate up to `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`.

## Recommendation

At some point, you should do `allocator.voiceCredits += voiceCreditsToAllocate`.
