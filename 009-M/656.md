# `distribute()` may be distributed in unexpected proportions due to the lack of guarantee that `distribute()` is executed after all `allocate()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Expected implementation:

The period allowed for executing `distribute` should not overlap with the period allowed for executing `allocate`.

Current implementation:

The period allowed for executing `distribute` overlaps with the period allowed for executing `allocate` at the allocationEndTime.

This leads to the possibility of an execution sequence like `allocate()`, `allocate()`, `allocate()`, `distribute()`, `allocate()`.

Allocator and PoolManager can be different personnel.

`allocate` is allowed when `block.timestamp == allocationEndTime`.

`distribute` is also allowed when `block.timestamp == allocationEndTime`.

This is a more practical issue on zkSync Era as the `block.timestamp` on zkSync Era reflects the `block.timestamp` on L1, which means that multiple blocks will share the same `block.timestamp`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider only being able to `allocate()` when `block.timestamp < allocationEndTime` or only being able to `distribute()` when `block.timestamp > allocationEndTime`.
