# a user can still more fund than intended
## Summary
if the pending milestone is approved and it is going to be distributed a malicious user can front run and update the milestone percentage by calling alloc.registerRecipient and updating  proposalBid with maxBid

## Vulnerability Detail
in the contract RFPSimpleStrategy  the function _distribute is usedd to transferd funds and it uses 
`uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;`\
to calculate the amount that is going to be transferred but  recipient.proposalBid can be changed by calling  alloc.registerRecipient and updating  proposalBid with maxBidso what a malcius user can do is first set the proposalBid small to fault users so that is will get approved then when the distrubte function is called make the proposalBid to max so that amount will be big 
## Impact
steal funds
