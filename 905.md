# Wrongly changed status in registerRecipient function
## Summary
Wrongly changed status in registerRecipient function

## Vulnerability Detail
When a newly added recipient is accepted, it is possible for their status to be changed by mistake from `Accepted` to `Pending`. If a member adds the same recipient again and their status is already `Accepted`, it means that other pool managers accepted the recipient, the status can be reset to `Pending` by calling the `registerRecipient` function again.

```solidity
//note why when is accepted go to pending?
//@audit-issue M3: when recipient is accepted, he should be able to
// allocate votes, but can be reseted to pending again
if (currentStatus == Status.Accepted) {

    // recipient updating accepted application
    recipient.recipientStatus = Status.Pending; //@note why is not InReview here?

} else if (currentStatus == Status.Rejected) {
```

## Impact
This can disrupt the allocation of their votes until the pool manager accepts the recipient again.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L421

```solidity
       // update the recipients data
        recipient.recipientAddress = recipientAddress;
        recipient.metadata = metadata;
        recipient.useRegistryAnchor = registryGating ? true : isUsingRegistryAnchor;

        Status currentStatus = recipient.recipientStatus;

        if (currentStatus == Status.None) {
            // recipient registering new application
            recipient.recipientStatus = Status.Pending;
            emit Registered(recipientId, _data, _sender);
        } else {
            if (currentStatus == Status.Accepted) {
                // recipient updating accepted application
                recipient.recipientStatus = Status.Pending;
            } else if (currentStatus == Status.Rejected) {
                // recipient updating rejected application
                recipient.recipientStatus = Status.Appealed;
            }

            // emit the new status with the '_data' that was passed in
            emit UpdatedRegistration(recipientId, _data, _sender, recipient.recipientStatus);
        }
    }
```
