# The protocol is incompatible with fee-on-transfer tokens
## Summary
It is stated that the protocol will interact with all ERC20 tokens. However, fee-on-transfer tokens are treated just as any other ERC20s in the `_fundPool()` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
While funding a pool through the `_fundPool()` function, the amount passed as an argument (minus the protocol fees, if any) is then added to the `poolAmount` storage variable, which accounts for all the available tokens in strategy. This is an issue in case of deflationary tokens. Since they deduct fees on token transfer, the actual amount held by the contract would be less than the amount written in the `poolAmount` variable.
This inconsistency will result in dos of distributions, tokens being stuck at strategy and loss of funds for users. This all applies to QV strategy as it does not have the function to withdraw tokens.
## Impact
Dos of distributions, tokens being stuck at QV strategy and loss of funds for users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider comparing an amount before token transfer to amount after and adding the result of the comparison to the `poolAmount`.
