# poolIds array in batchAllocate function does not exceed a reasonable limit before using it in the loop cause an overflow
## Summary
- In the batchAllocate function, this line is used to determine the number of pools to iterate through:
`uint256 numPools = _poolIds.length;` and its the line that contain the issue.
## Vulnerability Detail
here is the function :
 ```solidity
 function batchAllocate(uint256[] calldata _poolIds, bytes[] memory _datas) external nonReentrant {
        uint256 numPools = _poolIds.length;

        // Reverts if the length of _poolIds does not match the length of _datas with 'MISMATCH()' error
        if (numPools != _datas.length) revert MISMATCH();

        // Loop through the _poolIds & _datas and call the internal _allocate() function
        for (uint256 i; i < numPools;) {
            _allocate(_poolIds[i], _datas[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }

```
The problem is from the fact that the length property of an array returns a `uint256,` an unsigned integer in Solidity. The maximum value that a `uint256` can hold is `115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935.` Attempting to create more than this number of pools would result in an  overflow, effectively resetting the numPools variable to 0.
When the number of _poolIds exceeds the maximum value of uint256, an  overflow occurs, setting numPools to 0. This would cause the loop to terminate prematurely, and leading to unexpected behavior.
and if an attacker can create a large number of _poolIds to trigger the overflow, causing the function to revert. This  lead to DOS attack, as legitimate users may be unable to use the contract.
here is a simple scenario :
-  an attacker with malicious intent notices the issue in the function. and realize that the numPools variable is of type uint256, which has a maximum value.
- The attacker decides to exploit this by creating an array of _poolIds that exceeds the maximum value of uint256. 
- Let's say they create an array with 2000 pool IDs: [1, 2, 3, ..., 2000].
- When the batchAllocate function is called with this array, the numPools variable initially holds the value 2000, which is fine, as the loop iterates through the _poolIds, it encounters the `115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936th` pool ID. This is where the problem arises.
- Since uint256 cannot represent values beyond its maximum, an overflow occurs. As a result, the numPools variable wraps around to 0.
- The loop, which was intended to iterate through 2000 pool IDs, now terminates  after processing a part of them because numPools is reset to 0.
- The attacker successfully executed a DoS attack on the contract.

## Impact

an attacker can create a large enough array of _poolIds, they can cause the batchAllocate function to overflow and terminate prematurely. This would prevent legitimate users from using the function, effectively performing a DOS attack.

## Recommendation
 check that the length of the _poolIds array does not exceed a reasonable limit before using it in the loop.
here is an example :
```solidity
uint256 numPools = _poolIds.length;

// Define a reasonable maximum number of pools
uint256 MAX_POOL_IDS = 1000;

// Check if numPools is within a reasonable range to prevent overflow
require(numPools <= MAX_POOL_IDS, "NumPools exceeds maximum allowed");

```
