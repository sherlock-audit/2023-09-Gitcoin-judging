# Fee-on-Transfer Tokens Issue in `_fundPool()`
## Summary
The `_fundPool()` method within the provided smart contract does not correctly support fee-on-transfer tokens. When such tokens are used, the `_strategy.increasePoolAmount()` method can potentially receive an inaccurate value due to the fee deductions inherent in the token transfer itself, leading to discrepancies in pool funding.

## Vulnerability Detail
Fee-on-transfer tokens automatically deduct a fee on every transfer. The issue arises when the `_fundPool()` method tries to fund a pool with such a token. The logic calculates and deducts the `feeAmount` and then transfers the `amountAfterFee` to the strategy. However, since the token itself deducts a fee on transfer, the actual amount received by the strategy might be less than `amountAfterFee`. This discrepancy is not accounted for, and as a result, `_strategy.increasePoolAmount()` is called with a potentially incorrect value.

## Impact
This can lead to significant discrepancies in the recorded and actual amounts within the strategy.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue:

1. Before the transfer, check the balance of the strategy.
2. After the transfer, check the balance again to get the actual transferred amount.
3. Use the actual transferred amount in the `_strategy.increasePoolAmount(`) method.
Here's the adjusted snippet:
```solidity
uint256 strategyBalanceBefore = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(_strategy));

_transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));

uint256 strategyBalanceAfter = IERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(_strategy));
uint256 actualTransferredAmount = strategyBalanceAfter - strategyBalanceBefore;

_strategy.increasePoolAmount(actualTransferredAmount);
```
