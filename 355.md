# The updateDistribution function can potentially be called multiple times, allowing the merkle root and distribution metadata to be updated more than once
## Summary
Code assumes updateDistribution can only be called once. A bug could allow it to be called multiple times. The updateDistribution function can potentially be called multiple times, allowing the merkle root and distribution metadata to be updated more than once
## Vulnerability Detail
The key part of the code is: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L427-L435) 
This check only prevents updateDistribution() from being called again if distributionStarted is true.
However, nothing prevents updateDistribution() from being called multiple times before distributionStarted is set to true.

A proof of concept exploit would be:
1. Call updateDistribution() initially to set merkle root and metadata
2. Recipients generate merkle proofs and plan distributions based on this
3. Call updateDistribution() again before distributionStarted is true, changing the merkle root
4. Now the original merkle proofs will be invalid
This allows the allocation details to be changed arbitrarily before the distribution starts.


## Impact
• The merkle root can be changed after it has already been set. This would invalidate any existing merkle proofs.
• The distribution metadata can be changed after it has already been set. This could change allocation details.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
updateDistribution() should have an additional check that requires merkleRoot to be empty before allowing an update
