# Missing Allocator Voice Credit Incrementation in QV Strategy _allocate()
In the `_allocate` function of the QVSimpleStrategy contract, the check `_hasVoiceCreditsLeft` does not accurately reflect the number of voice credits left for an allocator, since the `allocator.voiceCredits` is not updated after an allocation. This will lead to an allocator allocating more voice credits than the defined `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` maliciously or by accident.

## Vulnerability Detail
The bug is situated in the `_allocate` function of `QVSimpleStrategy.sol` where, even though there's a check to confirm if the allocator has voice credits left, it fails to correctly keep track of the total voice credits used by an allocator due to missing incrementation of `allocator.voiceCredits.` Below is the problematic segment of code:
```solidity
function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal virtual override {
    // ... (some lines omitted for brevity)

    if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();

    _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
    // allocator.voiceCredits is not incremented here, which it should be to keep track of the used credits
}
```
The `voiceCreditsToAllocate` can continuously be allocated as long as it's less than `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`, without accounting for previous allocations, which can potentially lead to an unlimited allocation of voice credits by bypassing the `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` restriction.

#### Proof of Concept:
Consider an allocator who has a `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` of 1000.
1. The allocator allocates 800 voice credits in one transaction. The `_hasVoiceCreditsLeft()` will return true because `800 < 1000 => True`.
2. Now, without the incrementation of `allocator.voiceCredits,` the allocator can again allocate another 500 (or any number below 1000) credits in another transaction, bypassing the maximum limit set per allocator `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`.

## Impact
An allocator can allocate any number below `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` any number of times of votes to a recipient  skewing the vote in favor of a specific recipient.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this bug, you should add a line in the `_allocate()` function that increments the `allocator.voiceCredits` by the amount of `voiceCreditsToAllocate` during each allocation, as shown below:
```solidity
function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal virtual override {
    // ... (some lines omitted for brevity)

    if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();

    _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
    allocator.voiceCredits += voiceCreditsToAllocate; // This line should be added to keep an accurate track of voice credits used by an allocator
}

```
