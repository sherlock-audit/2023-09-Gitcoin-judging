# `createPool()`: when the `msg.value` > `amount+ baseFee`, it will cause the user loss funds
## Summary

Let's imagine the following scenario:
1. Alice checks baseFee, then baseFee = 100, and then Alice is ready to call createPool, _amount = 100, msg.value = 201
2. At this time, Allo owner lowers baseFee = 50
3. Alice then calls createPool, but because the baseFee fee changes, Alice still uses the original baseFee, which will cause the user to lose 50 and cause 50 to remain in the contract.
