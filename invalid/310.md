# RFPCommiteeStrategy:_allocate allows to vote for arbitrary, unregistered recipient.
Whether by intent or accident pool-managers are able to vote on an arbitrary, unregistered recipient. 
## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `_allocate()` the variable `acceptedRecipientId` is set once  `votes[recipientId]` has reached the `voteThreshold`. However, at no point it is ensured that the provided `recipientId` is actually a registered recipient.
## Impact
The impact of this bug is mitigated by the fact that `voteThreshold` pool-managers would have to vote for the same `recipientId`.

However the impact is amplified because of bug #1 . If the `voteThreshold` were to be reached, whether by intent or accident, in the next step the unregistered recipient could set a new milestone, using bug #1 and then would be eligible for  the payout for the current milestone when `distribute()` is called.

## Code Snippet
The related code can be found in [RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol#L102-L138](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-committee/RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol#L102-L138).

The following code-snippet contains a foundry test to verify this issue:
In the test scenario the `voteThreshold == 2`. Hence, a second pool manager is added and vote is executed twice.
```solidity
    function test_allocate_RECIPIENT_BUG() public {
        // add pool manager
        vm.startPrank(pool_admin());
        allo().addPoolManager(strategy.getPoolId(), pool_manager1());
        vm.stopPrank();
        
        
        address recipientId = __register_recipient();
        __setMilestones();
        assertEq(strategy.acceptedRecipientId(), address(0));
        //vote x2 to reach threshold
        vm.prank(address(allo()));
        strategy.allocate(abi.encode(randomAddress()), address(pool_admin()));
        vm.prank(address(allo()));
        strategy.allocate(abi.encode(randomAddress()), address(pool_manager1()));

        assertEq(strategy.acceptedRecipientId(), randomAddress());
    }
```

Manual Review and Foundry

## Recommendation
Add a check in [RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol#L116](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-committee/RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol#L116) that the provided `recipientId` is a registered recipient.
```solidity
if (_recipients[recipientId].recipientStatus != Status.Pending) revert INVALID();
