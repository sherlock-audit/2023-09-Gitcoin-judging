# setPoolActive() is missing access control in RFPSimpleStrategy.sol
## Summary

The `setPoolActive()` function in RFPSimpleStrategy.sol is missing access control and can be called by anyone

## Vulnerability Detail

The `RFPSimpleStrategy` which is also used by other RFP Strategies contains a function `setPoolActive()` which is used to set the status of the pool. The problem is that this function doesnt have access control so anyone can call this function and set the status to the status they want to. 

## Impact

Anyone can call this function so when the pool is supposed to be active like when registering recipients the attacker can set the pool to be inactive and calls to `registerRecipient()` will fail because of the `onlyActivePool` modifier. 

The attacker can then make the pool active when its supposed to be inactive and the pool manager can fail to distibute the funds

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219

```solidity

216: /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
217: /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
218: /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
219: function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
220:     _setPoolActive(_flag);
221:     emit PoolActive(_flag);
222: }

```

As you can see the comment above this function says that the msg.sender must be a pool manager but the function is missing access control and `_setPoolActive()` also doesnt have any access control.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` modifier so only the manager is able to set the status
