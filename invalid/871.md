# Missing payable in "function distribute" which makes it impossible to operate with native tokens
The _distribute function is not marked payable. This will make it impossible for the contract to work with native assets and deny recipients from receiving tokens after allocation period.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
After allocation period, the function _distribute is essential in distributing tokens to recipients, but the function when called externally in the allo contract and also internally in the basestrategy contract is not tagged payable which will make it impossible for the contract to distribute native asset to recipients.

## Impact
High
Function will revert and recipients would not be able to receive their tokens after pool allocation
