# registerRecipient() in Allo.sol is payable but it doesnt forward the ether to the strategy
## Summary

`registerRecipient()` in `Allo.sol` is marked as payable but it doesnt send the msg.value to the strategy when `strategy.registerRecipient()` is called.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Allo.sol` is designed to work with custom strategies and both `registerRecipient()` functions are marked as payable in `Allo.sol` and the `BaseStrategy.sol` meaning that it can receive ether. 

The problem is that when calling `strategy.registerRecipient()` in `Allo.sol::registerRecipient()` the `msg.value` isnt forwarded so if a user wants his `registerRecipient()` function to receive ether then its not going to work. 

So for example a user has a custom strategy where he charges a fee or other users have to bid with ether to register a recipient. Because the `msg.value` isnt forwarded the tx can always revert or the users ether can get stuck in the `Allo.sol` contract

## Impact

`registerRecipient()` of custom strategies that receive ether arent going to work but more importantly the users ether can get stuck in `Allo.sol` because he wanted to send the ether to the strategy but `registerRecipient()` didnt forward that ether and the call didnt fail.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L303

```solidity
301: function registerRecipient(uint256 _poolId, bytes memory _data) external payable nonReentrant returns (address) {
302:     // Return the recipientId (address) from the strategy
303:     return pools[_poolId].strategy.registerRecipient(_data, msg.sender);
304: }

```

As you can see here the function is payable but the msg.value isnt sent to the strategy when `strategy.registerRecipient()` is called

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Forward the ether to the strategy

```solidity
return pools[_poolId].strategy.registerRecipient{value: msg.value}(_data, msg.sender); 
```
