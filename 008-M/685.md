# The milestone's status can be changed by unauthorized users in RFPSimpleStrategy
The milestone's status can be changed by unauthorized users in RFPSimpleStrategy.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the comments, 'msg.sender' must be the 'acceptedRecipientId' **and** must be a member of a 'Profile'. The operation is not allowed as long as any one of the conditions is not met. So line 255 should be changed to 
if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender **||** !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender))
