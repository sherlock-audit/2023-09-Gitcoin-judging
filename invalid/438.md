# Pool creator can lose pool
A pool creator/admin can lose his pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
A pool can be created by [a profile owner or a profile member](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L164.). The pool creator also gets [admin rights](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L445.). This means when a profile member creates a pool, he becomes the admin and owner essentially. However his profile membership can still be revoked by the profile owner using the [removeMembers](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L306) function. 

## Impact
This means the profile member/pool owner loses his pool and the pool loses its governacne. In a case where the pool owner is also the only pool manager, revoking his membership status on the profile can lead to the pool and its funds being lost. This is because the [recoverFunds](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L287) function recovers the funds to the recipient which is the pool owner.

## Recommendation
If profile member owns a pool, he should have protection from being removed from profile.
