# `_createPool` in `Allo.sol` is forcing the users to pay more fees in native tokens than it should
In the `_createPool` function, in the case where the `baseFee` is greater than 0, the user needs to pay the `baseFee` in native token to the `treasury`, but as the code is written right now, it is forcing the users to pay more native tokens than it should, tokens which will remain in the contract until the owner get them back. 
## Vulnerability Detail
As you can see in the `_createPool` after multiple actions, it checks if the `baseFee` variable is set and if it is greater than 0, then it uses that value to pay the fees to the treasury in the native token

, but the way the `if` statement is written, it forces the users to pay more native tokens than it should. As it says in the comments the `if` statement was used to prevent paying the `baseFee` from the Allo contract 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L470
but the `if` statement enforces that the `msg.value` must be always greater than the `baseFee` or `baseFee` + `amount`

to not revert, so because of that the users need to always provide more native tokens than it needs in reality, surplus that is not transferred and remains in the contract. This thing can be seen as a hidden tax beside the `baseFee` and the `precentFee` paid by the users already, which is disadvantageous for the users.
## Impact
Impact is a high one since it forces the users to pay more funds than it should, beside the `baseFee` and `precentFee`, funds which will be lost from their perspective, even if the owner can retrieve them from the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of using `>=` in the `if` statement, use just `>` , in that way the users can provide exactly the specific amount of fee it needs to be paid, which will also prevent paying `baseFee` from the Allo contract.
