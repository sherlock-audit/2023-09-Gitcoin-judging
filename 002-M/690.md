# `Allo.sol`: when fund the fee-on-transfer token, the `poolAmount` may not match the actual token amount.
The `poolAmount` can be different from the actual token amount when funding fee-on-transfer tokens into the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_fundPool`, `msg.sender` transfers amount tokens to the `_strategy`. However, if the token is a fee-on-transfer token, the `_strategy` may receive less token than the amount transferred.  
After the token transfer, it directly adds `amountAfterFee` to the `poolAmount`, leading to the  `poolAmount` not matching the actual amount in the pool.

```solidity
    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;
       ...
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);
       ...
    }
```

```solidity
    function increasePoolAmount(uint256 _amount) external override onlyAllo {
        _beforeIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
        poolAmount += _amount;
        _afterIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
    }
```

## Impact
This vulnerability may cause revert when distributing tokens to recipients due to the poolAmount not matching the expected amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To ensure the poolAmount matches the actual token amount in the pool, it is recommended to check the token balance before and after the transfer when updating the poolAmount.
