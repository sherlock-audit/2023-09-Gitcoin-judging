# Inadequate Array Length Verification in `_distribute` Function
## Summary
The `_distribute` function in the smart contract lacks explicit verification of the equality of array lengths between the payout array and the `_recipientIds` array. This oversight can potentially lead to unintended behavior or vulnerabilities if the arrays have different lengths.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `_distribute` function is responsible for distributing payouts to recipients based on the provided payout array and `_recipientIds` array. However, it does not validate that the lengths of these two arrays are equal, which can introduce issues.
Here is the relevant code snippet:
```solidity
uint256 payoutLength = _recipientIds.length;
for (uint256 i; i < payoutLength;) {
    address recipientId = _recipientIds[i];
    Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];

    PayoutSummary memory payout = _getPayout(recipientId, "");
    uint256 amount = payout.amount;

    if (paidOut[recipientId] || !_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId) || amount == 0) {
        revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
    }

    // ... (payout logic)

    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}

```
The function assumes that the `payout` array and `_recipientIds` array have the same length, and it iterates through them in parallel. If the arrays have different lengths, this can lead to:
## Impact
The potential impact of this issue is that the function may not work as expected. If the arrays have different lengths, the loop may not iterate over all elements in one of the arrays. This can result in some recipients not receiving their payouts as expected or receiving more payouts than intended. Additionally, it may allow for unintended behavior or reverts in certain scenarios.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is advisable to add explicit length verification before proceeding with the distribution of payouts.
