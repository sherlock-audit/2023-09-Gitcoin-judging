# Gas Efficient Square Root Calculation with Binary Search Approach
## Summary

An Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) introducing a gas-efficient method for computing square roots in Solidity using a binary search algorithm, aiming to reduce gas consumption for contracts that require such computations.

## Vulnerability Detail

The vulnerability does not pertain to security but rather to efficiency. qv-base strategy contracts, especially  often require square root computations. The widely adopted Babylonian method, based on Newtonâ€™s approach, consumes varying amounts of gas depending on the input size. The proposed binary search method provides a more consistent and in many cases, a more gas-efficient way to compute square roots, especially for larger input sizes.

## Impact

Based on [EIP-7054](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-7054-gas-efficient-square-root-calculation-with-binary-search-approach/14539) and [my local tests](https://github.com/Aghas2408/sqrt_gas_test) from 1E+18 values there is around 5.3x gas optimization, and because in QVBaseStrategy.sol input of **_sqrt** function alwats multiplied with 1E+18 value, there is possible a lot of gas optimization by switching to **Square Root Calculation with Binary Search Approach**.
