# The calculation is wrong in `_qv_allocate` wtih `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;`
The calculation is wrong in `_qv_allocate`, `QVBaseStrategy.sol` wtih `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;`, because it is summing the prize twice
## Vulnerability Detail
When you are allocating you set a VoiceCreditsToAllocate, they are set in `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient`, but if you use the function twice it would happen this scenario:
First time: 
_voiceCreditsToAllocate = 1000
creditsCastToRecipient = 0 
totalCredits = 0
_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient = 1000
This is all correct, but in the second time
Second time:
we are setting the new credit to be 500
_voiceCreditsToAllocate = 500;

this time the creditsCastToRecipient will be 1000, because the last time we entered the `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` was set to 1000:
https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L517

Now, we are calculating the totalCredits that will equal to = 1500;
https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L521

And when it is updating the `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` it is adding the new totalCredits, and it will equals to 
= 2500
https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L529

But in reality, it should be equal to = 1500, because the credits we sent we only 1500, not 2500

This can be done multiple time e.g. first time you are sending 5000 credits, and after that on the second time you are sending only 1 credit and it will be added 5000 as well, you can do this 3 time, 4 time etc. 

## Impact
Griefing with the system, unvalidated data, getting more voiceCredits than user should

## Recommendation
 - _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
 + _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] = totalCredits;
