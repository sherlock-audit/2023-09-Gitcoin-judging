# Unprotected `initialize` functions can be `front-run` by MEV bots or by Attackers.
## Summary

It should be avoided that the implementation of proxy contracts can be initialized by third parties. This can be the case if the `initialize` function is unprotected. Since the implementation contract is not meant to be used directly without a proxy delegate-calling it is recommended to protect the initialization method of the implementation by initializing on deployment.

Changing the proxy implementation to a version that does not protect the initialization method may allow someone to front-run and initialize the contract if it is not done within the same transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail
## Code Snippet

The `initialize` functions of the `Allo` and `Registry` contracts are unprotected and vulnerable to attack by MEV bots or Attackers.

`Allo Contract`

[Allo.sol - Lines 87 - 89](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L87-L89)

```solidity
function initialize(
    address _registry,
    address payable _treasury,
    uint256 _percentFee,
    uint256 _baseFee
) external reinitializer(1) {
    // Initialize the owner using Solady ownable library
    _initializeOwner(msg.sender);

    // Set the address of the registry
    _updateRegistry(_registry);

    // Set the address of the treasury
    _updateTreasury(_treasury);

    // Set the fee percentage
    _updatePercentFee(_percentFee);

    // Set the base fee
    _updateBaseFee(_baseFee);
}
```

`Registry Contract`

[Registry.sol - Line 79](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L79)

```solidity
/// @notice Initializes the contract after an upgrade
/// @dev During upgrade -> a higher version should be passed to reinitializer. Reverts if the '_owner' is the 'address(0)'
/// @param _owner The owner of the contract
function initialize(address _owner) external reinitializer(1) {
    // Make sure the owner is not 'address(0)'
    if (_owner == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

    // Grant the role to the owner
    _grantRole(ALLO_OWNER, _owner);
}
```

Here we can see anyone can call these functions after deployment of the contracts and MEV bots are very fast which can call these functions very quickly after the deployment.

## Impact

These parameters are very critical to operate the Allo protocol properly which can be manipulated by an attacker to incorrectly initialize the contract.

### Proofs

### 1. Initializer - Documentation

-   The contract has an `initialize` function that initializes the contract after an upgrade.
-   The function takes `_registry`, `_treasury`, `_percentFee`, and `_baseFee` as parameters and sets various contract parameters, such as treasury, registry, percentage fee, and base fee.
-   This function can only be called by the contract owner.

### 2. Discussion with the Protocol Team

<img width="888" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-21 at 12 17 17 PM" src="https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-alymurtazamemon/assets/56123405/23bb4ba7-5e21-4ab8-ad3e-4bbfe1686d5d">

Here I confirm the protocol about other `initialize` functions of different strategy contracts such as `RFPSimpleStrategy`, `RFPCommitteeStrategy`, etc. Those were also unprotected on a higher level but the team confirmed that these are protected internally using the `initialize` function of the `BaseStrategy` contract.

```solidity
function __BaseStrategy_init(uint256 _poolId) internal virtual onlyAllo {
    // check if pool ID is not initialized already, if it is, revert
    if (poolId != 0) revert ALREADY_INITIALIZED();

    // check if pool ID is valid and not zero (0), if it is, revert
    if (_poolId == 0) revert INVALID();

    poolId = _poolId;
}
```

[BaseStrategy.sol - Line 141](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L141)

This evidence shows that the team knows that the protection `modifier` is necessary.

`Note: In the provided above issues, there is no protection modifier in the internal functions also which you can verify.`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Initialize unprotected implementation contracts in the implementationâ€™s constructor.
2. Protect initialization methods from being called by unauthorized parties or ensure that deployment of the proxy and initialization is performed in the same transaction.
3. Use a factory pattern that will prevent front-running of the initialization, or
4. Ensure the deployment scripts are robust in case of a front-running attack.

Carefully review the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions), especially the Warnings section. Carefully
review the [pitfalls](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2018/09/05/contract-upgrade-anti-patterns/) of using delegatecall proxy pattern.
