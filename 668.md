# Distribution in QVBaseStrategy may fail in the middle of a distribution iteration costing substantial amounts of gas
## Summary

The _distribute function will fail if a recipient is already paid out or isn’t an accepted recipient or the amount is zero. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The _distribute function in the QVBaseStrategy contract will iterate through the list of users to be paid out however, if the user in question is already paid out, isn’t an accepted recipient or the amount is zero, the loop will fail mid iteration without accounting for the rest of the users. High gas fees may be paid when processing this particular transaction considering that there are numerous operations performed within a loop which can make a revert quite costly for the executor. 

## Impact

If certain conditions are met, the executor of the _distribute function may lose a substantial amount due to costly gas fees.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A robust solution would be to consider using the `continue` keyword within the loop to go straight to the next user to be paid out.
