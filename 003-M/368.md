# `allocator.voiceCredits` in QVSimpleStrategy contract is not getting updated in `allocate()` function causing unlimited voting power
`allocator.voiceCredits` in QVBaseStrategy contract is not getting updated in `allocate()` causing unlimited voting power
## Vulnerability Detail
The purpose of `allocator.voiceCredits` variable is checking how much that allocator have voted. But `allocator.voiceCredits` is not getting updated anywhere, making it always be `0`
## Impact
Allocator can exploit it by calling `allocate()` multiple time with `voiceCreditsToAllocate` input equal to `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` variable, so that it can surpass this requirement:
```solidity
if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();
```
```solidity
    function _hasVoiceCreditsLeft(uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate, uint256 _allocatedVoiceCredits)
        internal
        view
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        return _voiceCreditsToAllocate + _allocatedVoiceCredits <= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator;
    }
```
By calling multiple time, allocators basically have unlimited voting power

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add this line:
```solidity
    function _qv_allocate(
        Allocator storage _allocator,
        Recipient storage _recipient,
        address _recipientId,
        uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate,
        address _sender
    ) internal onlyActiveAllocation {
       ...

        // update the values
        voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
        totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
        _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;

        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
        _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;

+      _allocator.voiceCredits += _voiceCreditsToAllocate;
    }

```
