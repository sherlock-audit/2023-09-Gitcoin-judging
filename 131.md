# Payouts could be diluted by votes allocated to rejected recipients in `QV` strategies
## Summary
Payouts are diluted by votes allocated to rejected recipients in `QV` strategies due to `totalRecipientVotes` also accounting for votes allocated to rejected recipients.

## Vulnerability Detail
Accepted recipients may be rejected by pool managers through `reviewRecipients` (potentially due to new information about their proposal/project), in which case they are ineligible to be distributed funds.

```solidity
    function reviewRecipients(address[] calldata _recipientIds, Status[] calldata _recipientStatuses)
        external
        virtual
        onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)
        onlyActiveRegistration
    {
        ...
        for (uint256 i; i < recipientLength;) {
            ...
            if (reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus] >= reviewThreshold) {
                Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
                recipient.recipientStatus = recipientStatus;

                emit RecipientStatusUpdated(recipientId, recipientStatus, address(0));
            }
        ...
        }
    }
```

```solidity
            if (paidOut[recipientId] || !_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId) || amount == 0) {
                revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
            }
```
The issue is the votes allocated to them are not subtracted from `totalRecipientVotes`, which is used as the denominator for determining the payouts for accepted recipients in `_getPayout` (used in `_distribute`).

```solidity
    function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (PayoutSummary memory)
    {
        Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];

        // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
        uint256 amount;
        if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
            amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
        }
        return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
    }
```
Consequently, payouts received by accepted recipients would less than expected with excess amounts left in the pool (reserved for rejected recipients who can't be distributed to).

Note that there is no recovery function for the `QV` strategies, so these funds would be locked. A pool manager would have to update the pool timestamps to enable active registration, after which the accepted recipients would have to have a member register again (to bypass the `paidOut` mapping) and more votes would have to be allocated to them to allow the pool manager to distribute funds to them. Otherwise, the rejected recipients would have to be accepted, and the funds distributed to them.

## Impact
Accepted recipients receive less funding than expected (and locked funds without going through an involved process to transfer them to the accepted receivers).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider summing the votes allocated to recipients that have their status updated to `Rejected` from `Accepted` in `reviewRecipients` and subtracting this from `totalRecipientVotes`. Additionally, sum votes allocated to those being `Accepted` (should be 0 if they haven't been accepted before since you can only allocate to accepted recipients) and add this to `totalRecipientVotes`.
