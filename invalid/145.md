# `_grantRole` will not triggered
Allo._createPool is responsible for creating pools, firstly it validates if the calling user is the profile owner or not, than it increment the poolindex by 1 that is the poolId, after that it generates the `POOL_MANAGER_ROLE` and `POOL_ADMIN_ROLE` roles than it creates a pool instance by taking in certain parameters used in creating new pool, than it add the poolId to the mapping of created pools further it grants admin and manager roles than it calls to `initialize` function later it makes a check  for poolId and strategy address validation next it assigns manager role to manager array.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem in this function is that, it do not move to next manager address if previous manager address found to be zero address,

#Allo.sol#L457-L467
```solidity
 // grant pool managers roles
        uint256 managersLength = _managers.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < managersLength;) {
            address manager = _managers[i];
            if (manager == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

            _grantRole(POOL_MANAGER_ROLE, manager);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```

in the above for loop `if (manager == address(0))` gets to true revert will trigger without increment, which will leads to call the same manager index address again which points to zero address and again it will make a revert to happen Which shouldn't be the case instead it should increment the index, which on next line will grant `POOL_MANAGER_ROLE` to manager address if its not zero address.

## Impact
`_grantRole` will not triggered, which can lead to `POOL_MANAGER_ROLE` not set to any address therefore the operation which requires `POOL_MANAGER_ROLE` to execute will remain unexecute.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make increment before validating the manager address.
