# The overpayment for one pool by Allo.createPool() might be stolen and used to fund another pool due to failure to check msg.value == baseFee + _amount.
## Summary
The overpayment for one pool by Allo.createPool() might be stolen and used to fund another pool due to failure to check ``msg.value == baseFee + _amount``. Such exploit is possible because of the following issues:

1) ``Allo.createPool()`` only checks to ensure that ``msg.value >= baseFee + _amount`` and does not check ``msg.value == baseFee + _amount``, therefore, overpayment is possible. Not just due to user's mistake, see the scenario below.

2) ``Allo.fundPool()`` does not check that ``msg.value == amount``, so underpayment is possible.  Overpayment is also possible as well, which is another issue. 

3) The overpayment by ``Allo.createPool()`` can be stolen and used to pay another pool by calling ``Allo.fundPool()`` with underpayment. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The following scenario shows how the funding for one pool can be stolen to fund another pool. Assume both pool1 and pool2 use native tokens. 

1) Alice calls ``Allo.createPool()`` to create pool1 with msg.value = 1100 where 100 is the base fee and 1000 is the amount to fund pool1. Suppose baseFee = 100.

2) Before Alice's transaction is committed, the Allo owner calls ``updateBaseFee()`` to change the base fee to zero. 

3) Alice's transaction is committed next with ``msg.value = 1100``. Since now base fee = 0. The 100 overpayment belongs to the contract, while 1000 is funded to pool 1. The transaction is successful since the condition ``msg.value >= baseFee + _amount`` is still satisfied.

4) Bob calls ``fundPool(pool2, 1100)`` with ``msg.value = 1000``. The extra overpayment of 100 by Alice will be stolen by Bob to fund pool2 - Bob only needs to pay 1000 while specifying input amount = 1100. The 100 difference will be paid by Alice's overpayment of 100. Such underpayment is fine due to the lack of checking ``amount == msg.value``.

In conclusion, Alice pays 100 extra, while Bob pays 100 less by stealing the 100 from Alice. 

## Impact
The overpayment for one pool by Allo.createPool() might be stolen and used to fund another pool due to failure to check msg.value == baseFee + _amount.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add checks to both ``Allo.createPool()`` and ``Allo.fundPool()`` to ensure that both overpayment and underpayment are impossible.
