# Fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported
## Summary

A strategy balance can be less than `poolAmount` when funding a pool on `Allo.sol` with fee-on-transfer tokens . So the distribution based on the `poolAmount` variable will be broken due to insufficient balance.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol intends to support fee-on-transfer tokens when funding a pool on `Allo.sol`. It is impossible to track the actual amount of received tokens because of absence of before / after transfer strategy balance checks at the `_fundPool` function. So the strategy balance can be less than `poolAmount`. Strategies use the `poolAmount` variable in distribution functionality. The difference between actual token balance and `poolAmount` stored value can cause insufficient balance error.

## Impact

A strategy balance can be less than `poolAmount`. So the distribution based on the `poolAmount` variable will be broken due to insufficient balance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider increasing `poolAmount` with the difference between the strategy balance after / before transfer.
