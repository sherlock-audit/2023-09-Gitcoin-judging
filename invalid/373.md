# Wrong check in Allo::createPool() force users to pay extra

**`Allo::createPool()`** have a wrong check which will force users to pay more eth than inteded.

## Vulnerability Detail

***Here is the check implementation:***

```solidity
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
```

***Now, let's break down the check:***

- The first part checks if **`token == ETH`** and whether the sum of `**baseFee + _amount >= msg.value`**. This part essentially checks if there are enough funds (Ether) to cover the fee and the amount being sent when dealing with Ether.

- The second part checks if **`_token != ETH`** (meaning it's another token) and whether `**baseFee >= msg.value`**. This part checks if there are enough funds (of the other token) to cover the fee.

The issue is that the check will revert with **`NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS`** if the creator sends exactly the required amount.

## Impact

Creators will have to pay extra which is not intended and will cause external integration and UI problems due to the incorrect check logic.

## Recommendation

To address this issue, we recommend updating the function as follow:

```solidity
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
```
