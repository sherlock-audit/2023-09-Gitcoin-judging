# The `profile owner` can lose funds using unsafe `low-level` call

The summary of the below detail is that the `low-level` calls `bypass type checking, function existence check, and argument packing` and due to the fact that the EVM considers a call to a non-existing contract to always succeed makes the below-mentioned code vulnerable.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
function execute(
    address _target,
    uint256 _value,
    bytes memory _data
) external returns (bytes memory) {
    // Check if the caller is the owner of the profile and revert if not
    if (!registry.isOwnerOfProfile(profileId, msg.sender))
        revert UNAUTHORIZED();

    // Check if the target address is the zero address and revert if it is
    if (_target == address(0)) revert CALL_FAILED();

    // Call the target address and return the data
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_data);

    // Check if the call was successful and revert if not
    if (!success) revert CALL_FAILED();

    return data;
}
```

The `execute` function of the `Anchor` contract after validating the `caller` and `_target` address for `address(0)` calls the `_targe` contract using the `low-level` call and checks only the `success` state of it.

This is unsafe because the `low-level` calls return `true` for all `non-existing` contract addresses.

`Note: This function has checked for address(0) but a non-existing contract can be a non-zero address`.

### Solidity Documentation Warning about `low-level` calls

-   You should avoid using `.call()` whenever possible when executing another contract function as it bypasses type checking, function existence check, and argument packing.

-   Due to the fact that the EVM considers a call to a non-existing contract to always succeed, Solidity includes an extra check using the `extcodesize` opcode when performing external calls. This ensures that the contract that is about to be called either actually exists (it contains code) or an exception is raised. The low-level calls which operate on addresses rather than contract instances (i.e. `.call()`, `.delegatecall()`, `.staticcall()`, `.send()` and `.transfer()`) **do not** include this check, which makes them cheaper in terms of gas but also less safe.

### Proof

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.0;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract ContractA {
    function check(address _target) external payable returns(bool) {
        console.log("called");
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: msg.value}("");
        require(success, "CALL_FAILED");

        console.log("succeed");
        console.log(success);
        return success;
    }
}

contract ContractB {
    function destroy() external {
        console.log("destroyed");
        selfdestruct(payable(address(0)));
    }
}
```

I have used this code to demonstrate, you can paste it into Remix IDE and verify it as well.

1. Deployed the `ContractB` which contains the `selfdestruct` function (copy the contract address for later).

2. Then call the `destroy` function of `ContractB` which will destroy this contract. After that, this contract will not exist anymore but its code still will be available on the blockchain.

3. Deploy the `ContractA`

4. Call the `check` function with the destroyed contract address and any `msg.value`.

As you can see the call went successful but the contract does not exist.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// Call the target address and return the data
(bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_data);

// Check if the call was successful and revert if not
if (!success) revert CALL_FAILED();
```

## Impact

Profile owners can accidentally lose funds by executing a call to a non-existing `targe`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the Openzeppelin [Address](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/Address.sol) library to perform the external call.
