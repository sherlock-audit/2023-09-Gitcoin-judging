# Unit of milliseconds instead of seconds for some timestamps can lead to DOS
In QVBaseStrategy.sol, there is a comment specifying that registrationStartTime, registrationEndTime, allocationStartTime and allocationEndTime should be in milliseconds.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L86-L91
```solidity
    /// @notice The start and end times for registrations and allocations
    /// @dev The values will be in milliseconds since the epoch
    uint64 public registrationStartTime;
    uint64 public registrationEndTime;
    uint64 public allocationStartTime;
    uint64 public allocationEndTime;
```
However, in Solidity, timestamps are usually denoted in seconds, for example "block.timestamp". If someone sets the 4 variables to values that are denoted in milliseconds, that could become an issue. For example:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L324-L328
```solidity
    /// @notice Check if the allocation has ended
    /// @dev Reverts if the allocation has not ended
    function _checkOnlyAfterAllocation() internal view virtual {
        if (block.timestamp < allocationEndTime) revert ALLOCATION_NOT_ENDED();
    }
```
If allocationEndTime is in milliseconds, it would mean that it would be 1000 times larger than block.timestamp and the _checkOnlyAfterAllocation() function will cause a revert for a long time. This function is used in the onlyAfterAllocation modifier, which in turn is applied to the _distribute() function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L181-L186
```solidity
    /// @notice Modifier to check if the allocation has ended
    /// @dev Reverts if the allocation has not ended
    modifier onlyAfterAllocation() {
        _checkOnlyAfterAllocation();
        _;
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L432-L465
```solidity
    /// @notice Distribute the tokens to the recipients
    /// @dev The '_sender' must be a pool manager and the allocation must have ended
    /// @param _recipientIds The recipient ids
    /// @param _sender The sender of the transaction
    function _distribute(address[] memory _recipientIds, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
        onlyAfterAllocation
    {
```
This means that the distribution will not be able to take place, since the call will revert, because of the big timestamp in milliseconds being evaluated against block.timestamp, which is in seconds.

## Impact
DOS - distribution of funds will not be able to take place. I decided to rank it as a medium since the pool manager can update the timestamps through a call to the updatePoolTimestamps() function. However, the comment in the codebase clearly says that the 4 timestamps should be in milliseconds, which is wrong, considering the scenario I've explained.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would recommend that the protocol either changes the instructions for timestamps to be in seconds instead of milliseconds. An alternative would be to use block.timestamp * 1000 in the comparisons.
