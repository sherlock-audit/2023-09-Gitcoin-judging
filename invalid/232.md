# The QVStrategy is missing withdraw utility, funds may get stuck
RFP* and Donation* strategies have an emergency withdraw utility. It is missing in QV* strategy, which means, if the pool fails to pay the recipient (due to pool or the recipient non conformance), then there is no possibility to retrieve the funds back. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `withdraw()` function is missing from QV* strategy contracts.

## Impact
If the QV* strategy based pool fails to pay the recipient, the funds will be stuck in the contract.

## Code Snippet
in `RFPSimpleStrategy` there is [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219) function:

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) onlyInactivePool {
        // Decrement the pool amount
        poolAmount -= _amount;

        // Transfer the amount to the pool manager
        _transferAmount(allo.getPool(poolId).token, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```
in `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol` there is [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L394) function:

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
        if (block.timestamp <= allocationEndTime + 30 days) {
            revert INVALID();
        }

        IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);

        if (_amount > poolAmount) {
            revert INVALID();
        }

        poolAmount -= _amount;

        // Transfer the tokens to the 'msg.sender' (pool manager calling function)
        _transferAmount(pool.token, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```

There is no such utility in `QVBaseStrategy.sol`, which should be analogous to other ones.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a `withdraw()` function which allows pool manager to rescue funds e.g. with `onlyActiveAllocation` modifier (as it could be presumably used if quorum is not met and the funds are not paid to the recipient in the end.
