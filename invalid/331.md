# For QV strategies, it is possible to frontrun distribution with votes allocation in the same block if the timestamp of distribution equals to allocationEndTime
## Summary
Both modifiers `_checkOnlyAfterAllocation()` and `_checkOnlyActiveAllocation()` return true for `block.timestamp == allocationEndTime`. If the distribution is to happen at timestamp of the `allocationEndTime`, an allocator can allocate his votes in favor of one or other recipient with a knowledge of the end result by frontrunning the distribution.
## Vulnerability Detail
As QV can be used for many things that involve decision-making procedures (such as members of a dao voting for proposals on fund allocation to a specific project, etc), it is essential to maintain the fairness of voting for all participants. However, the possibility to vote in the same block in which distribution happens may not be obvious to all voters. A tech-savvy allocator, on the other side, can take advantage of this flaw and put the fairness of quadratic voting in question.
## Impact
The fairness of QV might be put in question.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `_checkOnlyAfterAllocation()` should revert when `block.timestamp <= allocationEndTime`:
```solidity
    function _checkOnlyAfterAllocation() internal view virtual {
        if (block.timestamp <= allocationEndTime) revert ALLOCATION_NOT_ENDED();
    }
```
