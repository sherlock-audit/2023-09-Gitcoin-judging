# Unauthorized Registration Allowed in Specific way

## Vulnerability Detail
this line determines the `recipientId` based on whether the isUsingRegistryAnchor flag is true or false. If it's true, `recipientId` is set to `registryAnchor`, otherwise, it's set to `_sender.` so the issue  lies in how `recipientId` is determined when `isUsingRegistryAnchor` is true.
```solidity
recipientId = isUsingRegistryAnchor ? registryAnchor : _sender;
```
in this function 
```solidity
 function _registerRecipient(bytes memory _data, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyActiveRegistration
        returns (address recipientId)
    {
        address recipientAddress;
        address registryAnchor;
        bool isUsingRegistryAnchor;

        Metadata memory metadata;

        // decode data custom to this strategy
        if (registryGating) {
            (recipientId, recipientAddress, metadata) = abi.decode(_data, (address, address, Metadata));

            // when registry gating is enabled, the recipientId must be a profile member
            if (!_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
        } else {
            (recipientAddress, registryAnchor, metadata) = abi.decode(_data, (address, address, Metadata));
            isUsingRegistryAnchor = registryAnchor != address(0);
            recipientId = isUsingRegistryAnchor ? registryAnchor : _sender;

            // when using registry anchor, the ID of the recipient must be a profile member
            if (isUsingRegistryAnchor && !_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
        }

        // make sure that if metadata is required, it is provided
        if (metadataRequired && (bytes(metadata.pointer).length == 0 || metadata.protocol == 0)) {
            revert INVALID_METADATA();
        }

        // make sure the recipient address is not the zero address
        if (recipientAddress == address(0)) revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);

        Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];

        // update the recipients data
        recipient.recipientAddress = recipientAddress;
        recipient.metadata = metadata;
        recipient.useRegistryAnchor = registryGating ? true : isUsingRegistryAnchor;

        Status currentStatus = recipient.recipientStatus;

        if (currentStatus == Status.None) {
            // recipient registering new application
            recipient.recipientStatus = Status.Pending;
            emit Registered(recipientId, _data, _sender);
        } else {
            if (currentStatus == Status.Accepted) {
                // recipient updating accepted application
                recipient.recipientStatus = Status.Pending;
            } else if (currentStatus == Status.Rejected) {
                // recipient updating rejected application
                recipient.recipientStatus = Status.Appealed;
            }

            // emit the new status with the '_data' that was passed in
            emit UpdatedRegistration(recipientId, _data, _sender, recipient.recipientStatus);
        }
    }

```
- so for more details  when `registryGating` is enabled the registryGating is true and The _data is expected to be decoded with (recipientId, recipientAddress, metadata) and The recipientId is set to the provided recipientId, which must be a profile member.
- now we clear so when `registryGating` is disabled the registryGating is false.
and The _data is expected to be decoded with (recipientAddress, registryAnchor, metadata) and The recipientId is determined based on registryAnchor if it's not the zero address, otherwise, it's set to _sender.
- so the issue arise when registryGating is enabled and registryGating is true, and isUsingRegistryAnchor is also true. In this case, recipientId is set to registryAnchor, it doesn't ensure that registryAnchor is a profile member.

as an exapmle let's say : 
- `registryGating` is enabled `registryGating` is true.
- The contract enforces that only registered profile members can perform certain actions, such as registering recipients.
-  _data is encoded as `(recipientId,` recipientAddress, metadata).
Now the scenario is : 
- A malicious user let called YAN,  YAN deploys a contract and interacts with our smart contract.
- YAN sets registryGating to true, enabling the registry gating feature.
- YAN creates a fake recipientId that is not a registered profile member within the system.
- YAN sets isUsingRegistryAnchor to true.
- YAN now encodes _data as (fakeRecipientId, recipientAddress, metadata) and sends this data to the _registerRecipient function.
## Impact
the vulnerability allows unauthorized users to register recipients when `registryGating` is enabled, and also bypassing the intended access control mechanism. This can lead to unauthorized access or manipulation of data within the system

## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
check to ensure that registryAnchor is indeed a profile member before setting it as the recipientId.
```solidity
if (registryGating && !_isProfileMember(registryAnchor, _sender)) {
    revert UNAUTHORIZED();
}
recipientId = registryAnchor;
```
this will  revert with an "UNAUTHORIZED" error if registryGating is enabled and registryAnchor is not a profile member.
