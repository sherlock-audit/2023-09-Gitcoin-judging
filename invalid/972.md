# no check on return value of `create3`
The `deploy` function is used to deploy contracts. The function does not revert properly if there is a failed contract deployment or revert from the create3 opcode as it does not properly check the returned address.

## Vulnerability Detail
see summary

## Impact
If the function fails to deploy the contract the code will still assume that the deployment is successful which will cause unexpected issues.
