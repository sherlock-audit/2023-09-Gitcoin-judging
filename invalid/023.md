# Fixed Fee Calculation for Tokens with Varying Decimal Places

in Allo.sol  the following line :  https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/main/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L510



The current implementation of the contract assumes a fixed fee denominator of 1e18 for fee calculations. While this assumption works well for tokens with 18 decimal places, 

## Vulnerability Detail
it may lead to precision errors and unexpected behaviour when dealing with tokens that have a different number of decimals. This issue arises due to the inflexibility of the fee denominator.

## Impact

Medium

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }
```

```solidity
 function getFeeDenominator() public pure returns (uint256 FEE_DENOMINATOR) {
        return 1e18;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a dynamic fee calculation for tokens with varying  decimals places so that you check tokens that are being added  say  it should see if token has 6 decimals and adjust accordingly to avoid any errors
