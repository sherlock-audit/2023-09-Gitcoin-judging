# Funds may be stuck in QVSimpleStrategy in some cases
## Summary

[[Allo.fundPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L339-L345)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L339-L345) can be called by anyone at any phrase to increase the pool amount. If it is called after the allocation has ended, this may cause some funds to be left in QVSimpleStrategy.

## Vulnerability Detail

`fundPool` internally calls [[_strategy.increasePoolAmount to increase poolAmount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L517)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L517).

```solidity
File: contracts\strategies\BaseStrategy.sol
153:     function increasePoolAmount(uint256 _amount) external override onlyAllo {
154:         _beforeIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
155:->       poolAmount += _amount;
156:         _afterIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
157:     }
```

After the allocation ends, PoolManager can distribute the tokens to the recipients via [[Allo.distribute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L383-L385)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L383-L385). Its flow is as follows:

```flow
Allo.distribute
  BaseStrategy.distribute
    QVBaseStrategy._distribute
```

In `_distribute`, the payout of each recipient is calculated by `_getPayout`.

```solidity
File: contracts\strategies\qv-base\QVBaseStrategy.sol
436:     function _distribute(address[] memory _recipientIds, bytes memory, address _sender)
......
443:         uint256 payoutLength = _recipientIds.length;
444:         for (uint256 i; i < payoutLength;) {
445:             address recipientId = _recipientIds[i];
446:             Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
447: 
448:->           PayoutSummary memory payout = _getPayout(recipientId, "");
449:->           uint256 amount = payout.amount;
......
455:             IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
456:->           _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
......
464:         }
465:     }
```

The payout for calculating a single recipient is `poolAmount` multiplied by the percentage of the number of votes received by the recipient and the total number of votes.

```solidity
File: contracts\strategies\qv-base\QVBaseStrategy.sol
559:     function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
......
564:         returns (PayoutSummary memory)
565:     {
566:         Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];
567: 
568:         // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
569:         uint256 amount;
570:         if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
571:->           amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
572:         }
573:         return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
574:     }
```

Consider the following scenario:

For simplicity, after the allocation ends, pool.token is Ether and poolAmount is 100e18. There are a total of 2 recipients (A and B), and they received the same number of votes. Therefore both A and B should get 50e18 ether.

1. The pool manager calls `distribute` for A. So, A gets 50e18 ether.

2. Alice calls `fundPool`, `msg.vaule` is 10e18 ether. So, `poolAmount = 110e18`.

3. The pool manager calls `distribute` for B. So, B gets 55e18 ether. In this way, 5e18 is still stuck in the contract.

This will bring the following impacts:

1. The remaining tokens are stuck in the QVSimpleStrategy contract and can never be withdrawn.

2. The 10e18 ether transferred by Alice into the contract should be divided equally between A and B. However, A cannot get the 5e18 ether stuck in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's recommented to override `increasePoolAmount` and prevent it from being called after the allocation ends.
