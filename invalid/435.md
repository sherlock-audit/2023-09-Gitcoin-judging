# Stuck Ether/ Native Token in contracts
There are contracts with receive() functionality without the ability to withdraw or send out these native tokens 

## Vulnerability Detail
Contracts with  receive() functionality without the capabilities to use the funds, send out the funds, or withdraw the funds. 
1. Anchor.sol line 87 has no ability to withdraw Ether/tokens sent in direct 
```solidity 
/// @notice This contract should be able to receive native token
    receive() external payable {}
```

2. DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol line 843  has no ability to withdraw Ether/tokens sent in direct 
```solidity 
/// @notice This contract should be able to receive native token
    receive() external payable {}
```

3. RFPSimpleStrategy.sol line 500 has no ability to withdraw Ether/tokens sent in direct 
```solidity 
/// @notice This contract should be able to receive native token
    receive() external payable {}
```

## Impact
If Eth/Native Tokens is sent to these contracts directly as allowed by receive() or by error in the payable functions it is stuck and lost in the contracts forever

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider a withdraw function to rescue stuck funds, funds sent in by error or funds left in contracts
