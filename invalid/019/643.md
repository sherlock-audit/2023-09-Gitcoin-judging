# `Allo._createPool()` with `baseFee == 0` allows paying from the Allo contract's balance
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

When `baseFee == 0`, it should also require `msg.value >= baseFee + _amount`, to prevent paying from the Allo contract's balance. Otherwise, when `baseFee == 0`, it is possible to use the Allo contract's balance in `_fundPool()` at L481.

Given:
- `baseFee`: 0
- `percentFee`: 0.1e18 (i.e., 10%)

When:
- createPool{value: 90e18}({_token: NATIVE, _amount: 100e18, ...})
    - Allo contract receives 90e18 NATIVE tokens from msg.sender
    - Skips the if statement at line 469 because baseFee is 0 and not greater than 0
    - Calls `_fundPool({ _amount: 100e18 })` at line 481
        - amountAfterFee = _amount = 100e18 at line 504
        - _token = NATIVE at line 507
        - feeAmount = `(_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator() = 100e18 * 0.1e18 / 1e18 = 10e18` at line 510
        - `amountAfterFee -= feeAmount`, so amountAfterFee changes from 100e18 to 90e18 at line 511
        - Calls `_transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}))` which is equivalent to `_transferAmountFrom(NATIVE, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: 10e18}))` at line 513
            - amount = _transferData.amount = 10e18 at line 71 in Transfer.sol
            - msg.value < amount, i.e., 90e18 < 10e18 is false, so it does not revert at line 74 in Transfer.sol
            - SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(treasury, 10e18) transfers 10e18 from the Allo contract to treasury at line 76 in Transfer.sol
        - Calls `_transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}))` which is equivalent to `_transferAmountFrom(NATIVE, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: 90e18}))` at line 516
            - amount = _transferData.amount = 90e18 at line 71 in Transfer.sol
            - msg.value < amount, i.e., 90e18 < 90e18 is false, so it does not revert at line 74 in Transfer.sol
            - `SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_strategy, 90e18)` transfers 90e18 from the Allo contract to _strategy at line 76 in Transfer.sol
        - `_strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee)` is called, which is equivalent to _strategy.increasePoolAmount(90e18) at line 517
            - poolAmount += _amount, i.e., poolAmount += 90e18 at line 155 in BaseStrategy.sol

In the end,
- msg.sender pays 90e18 NATIVE and his pool.strategy also receives 90e18 NATIVE
- The Allo contract receives a total of 90e18 NATIVE and pays out 10e18 + 90e18 = 100e18 NATIVE

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Require `msg.value >= baseFee + _amount` when `token == NATIVE` regardless of whether base is 0:

```solidity
        // To prevent paying the fee from the Allo contract's balance
        // If _token is NATIVE, then msg.value should be >= than baseFee + _amount.
        // If _token is not NATIVE, then msg.value should be >= than baseFee.
        if (_token == NATIVE) {
            if (msg.value < baseFee + _amount) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
        } else {
            if (msg.value < baseFee) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
        }
```
