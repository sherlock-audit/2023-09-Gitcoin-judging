# QVSimpleStrategy contract lacks withdrawal method
## Summary

Since the amount is distributed according to the voting ratio, some recipients do not reach the voting threshold, so the proportion of distribution must be less than 100%. Since there is no withdrawal method, the undistributed amount will be locked.

## Vulnerability Detail
The method of distributing the amount is as shown in the following code
```solidity
    function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (PayoutSummary memory)
    {
        Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];

        // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
        uint256 amount;
        if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
            amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
        }
        return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
    }
```
If you want to distribute all the amounts, it is possible only if all recipients participate in the distribution.The actual situation is that the recipient needs to meet _isAcceptedRecipient to participate, and to meet _isAcceptedRecipient, the required conditions are as shown in the following code // found

```solidity
    function reviewRecipients(address[] calldata _recipientIds, Status[] calldata _recipientStatuses)
        external
        virtual
        onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)
        onlyActiveRegistration
    {
...
            reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus]++;
            if (reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus] >= reviewThreshold) { //found
                Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
                recipient.recipientStatus = recipientStatus;

                emit RecipientStatusUpdated(recipientId, recipientStatus, address(0));
            }

...
        }
    }
```
Therefore, there will be a situation where poolamout cannot be fully distributed. This will lead to a situation where funds are locked in the contract and cannot be used.

## Impact

Amounts not distributed will be locked

## Recommendation

Add a withdrawal method that only the pool manager can access
