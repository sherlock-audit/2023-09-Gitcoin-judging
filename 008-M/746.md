# The check of `submitUpcomingMilestone` in `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` can be bypassed because of the wrong operator used
`submitUpcomingMilestone` function uses an `if` statement to check if the caller is the `acceptedRecipientId` and a profile member, but the because of the fact the the wrong operator is used, this can be bypassed.
## Vulnerability Detail
As you can see here in the comments the `if` statement is used to check is the `msg.sender` is `acceptedRecipientId` and a profile member 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L250
but the way the `if` statement is written will basically check only for on instance and not both of them as intended. As can be seen, the `if` statement uses the `&&` operator 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L255-L257
which means that for the `if` statement  to go into the `revert` it needs for both statements to be false, and not just one. To check if the `msg.sender` is both `acceptedRecipientId` and a profile member or revert, the operator used need to be `||` so in the case where any of the two statements are false, it will go right into revert.
## Impact
Impact is a medium one since the check can be bypassed easily if for example the `msg.sender` is only a profile member but not the actual `acceptedRecipientId`.

## Recommendation
Use the `||` operator instead of `&&` to check for both cases, as stated in the comments.
