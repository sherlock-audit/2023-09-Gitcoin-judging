# `_qv_allocate` uses wrong math to add the  `totalCredits`
## Summary
[_qv_allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L506-L534) uses wrong math when adding `totalCredits` to `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]`. This will cause the allocators vice credits cast to be overinflated.

## Vulnerability Detail
When an allocator allocates voice credits a series of calls is performed, leading to the final  [_qv_allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L506-L534)  where our issue occurs.
The function extracts the [already allocated credits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L517) into memory (`creditsCastToRecipient`) and combines them with the current to be allocated credits into [totalCredits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L521). Then it uses the total credits to calculate the [voteResult](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L522C57-L522C57). After allocating the votes, it does the crucial mistake to increase ` _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` by `totalCredits`, and not `_voiceCreditsToAllocate`. This means that previously allocated credits are double added to the mapping. Which afterwards is used to [calculate the next vote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L522C57-L522C57) weight.

Example:
A total credits - **150**

 1. A allocates to **B** 100 credits 
      - **B** receives 10 votes as [voteResult = sqrt(totalCredits)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L522)
      - **A** `A.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[B] == 100`

 2. A allocates to **B** 1 credit
      - Now [totalCredits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L521C17-L521C29) are 101 (new 1 + old 100) and the sqrt(101) == 10.04
      - **B** receives 0.04 votes (10.04 - 10 = 0.04)
      - **A** `A.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[B]` are increased by 101 instead of 1 making it 201

 3. A allocates to **B** again 1 credit
      - Now [totalCredits](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L521C17-L521C29) are 202 (new 1 + old 201) and the sqrt(202) == 14.21
      - **B** receives 4.17 votes (14.21 - 10.04  = 4.17)
      - **A** `A.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[B]` are increased by 202 instead of 1 making it 403

This can continue onward increasingly inflating the votes.

## Impact
User can increase the votes of another user, without having the required weight to do so.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
     function _qv_allocate(
        Allocator storage _allocator,
        Recipient storage _recipient,
        address _recipientId,
        uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate,
        address _sender
    ) internal onlyActiveAllocation {
        if (_voiceCreditsToAllocate == 0) revert INVALID();

        uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
        uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId];

        uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
        uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);

        voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
        totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
        _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;

         //@audit H wrong addition, it should only add `_voiceCreditsToAllocate`
        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits; 
```

## Recommendation
```diff
     function _qv_allocate(...) internal onlyActiveAllocation {
          ...
-         _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits; 
+         _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += _voiceCreditsToAllocate; 
```
