# batchAllocate is Not Payable & Does Not Take msg.value
## Summary
The function `batchAllocate` should allow users to allocate to multiple pools, but is not `payable`. There also exists a function `allocate` which IS `payable`, and both of these functions call the internal `_allocate()`.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue is that `batchAllocate` is not `payable` and when it calls `_allocate` it will always revert when allocating native `ETH`. There is a dev comment that specifies that "..it's not payable, so if you want to send funds to the strategy, you must send the funds using `fundPool()`." But this is not related to Funding a pool, but to allocating to users.
## Impact
Complete redundancy of this function, can be completely deleted, or could be made `payable` to be functioning properly.
## Code Snippet
```javascript
function batchAllocate(uint256[] calldata _poolIds, bytes[] memory _datas) external nonReentrant {
        uint256 numPools = _poolIds.length;

        // Reverts if the length of _poolIds does not match the length of _datas with 'MISMATCH()' error
        if (numPools != _datas.length) revert MISMATCH();

        // Loop through the _poolIds & _datas and call the internal _allocate() function
        for (uint256 i; i < numPools;) {
            _allocate(_poolIds[i], _datas[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```
