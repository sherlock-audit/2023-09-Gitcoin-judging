# Late-arriving  funds to QV strategy can get stuck forever
## Summary

The QV strategy has no withdrawal mechanism, and no time limit on adding to the pool. If a miscommunication causes funds to be added after the first distribution,  funds will get stuck in the pool forever.

Although user error is typically considered invalid, this does not involve error from any single user, but rather a failure of coordination among them. It can occur even if no individual user makes a mistake. And the consequences are severe.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. A QVSimpleStrategy pool is created. Alice and Bob are the Pool managers. The pool is funded for 50k USDC.
2. People vote, and Carol gets 100% of the vote.
3. Bob goes out and fundraises another $50k for the pool.
4. Carol tells Alice she really needs the money, and asks her to distribute ASAP. Alice schedules a distribute() transaction
5. Before Alice's distribute() transaction runs, Bob goes to fund the pool for another 50k USDC
6. Unfortunately, Alice's call is run first. Carol gets 50k USDC. She is marked as having already been distributed to. Then 50k is added to the pool, but there is no-one to distribute to.
7. The remaining 50k USDC is stuck in the pool forever.

## Impact

A chance of permanent loss of funds

## Code Snippet

In QVBaseStrategy ( https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L30 ), see:

* Lack of  a withdraw() function
* Once someone is paid, they cannot be repaid. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L451C8-L451C8
* No time limit on pool funding. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L153
