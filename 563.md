# Missing 0 Address Check Could Break Voting Threshold Requirement
## Summary

In the contract `RFPCommitteeStrategy`, there's no check that the decoded `recipientId` is not 0 in line 115. If the `recipientId` is 0, then a single pool manager could allocate to 0 address repeatedly. In the second and subsequent votes, the `if` statement in line 109 would be `false`, so `votes[0]` would increment by 1 each time, until it reaches the `voteThreshold`, when the `acceptedRecipientId` will be set to 0 address. Essentially, a single pool manager could circumvent the voting threshold requirement and allocate funding to 0 address. This breaks the intended design that only a quorum of pool managers could determine allocation when they reach the voting threshold. 

## Vulnerability Detail

There's no input validation that pool manager cannot allocate to 0 address. 

## Impact

Voting threshold requirement can be broken by a single pool manager
