# `initialize()` in `Allo.sol` contract should be called by contract owner as per readme documentation
## Summary
Anyone can initialize the `Allo.sol` contract and become the owner

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact

In `Allo.sol`, `initialize()` function is used to initialize the `Allo.sol` contract.

```Solidity
File: allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol

    function initialize(address _registry, address payable _treasury, uint256 _percentFee, uint256 _baseFee)
        external
        reinitializer(1)
    {
        // Initialize the owner using Solady ownable library
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);

        // Set the address of the registry
        _updateRegistry(_registry);

        // Set the address of the treasury
        _updateTreasury(_treasury);

        // Set the fee percentage
        _updatePercentFee(_percentFee);

        // Set the base fee
        _updateBaseFee(_baseFee);
    }
```

The function can only be called as it has used openzeppelin initializer modifier but the issue is that anyone can call this function and become the owner due to below code

```Solidity
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);
```

A malicious attacker can use fake `registry` and `treasury` addresses and can be initialized the contract by front running the transaction. A deniel of service can also happen if the attacker repeatedly performs the initialization of `Allo.sol` by paying higher gas and wont let to allow the actual owners to initialize it.

**Per contest readme Allo documentation**

> The contract has an initialize function that initializes the contract after an upgrade.
The function takes _registry, _treasury, _percentFee, and _baseFee as parameters and sets various contract parameters, such as treasury, registry, percentage fee, and base fee.
This function can only be called by the contract owner.

Now, check this line,
> This function can only be called by the contract owner.

Here, it clearly mentions that the `initialize()` must only be called be contract owner, However this is missing in current implementation. This must be ensured in `Allo.sol` `initialize()` function.

## Recommendation
Allow the contract owner to `initialize()` the `Allo.sol` contract per the contest readme documentation.
