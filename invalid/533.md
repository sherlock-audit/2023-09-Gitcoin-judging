# User can escape from paying fees when funding a pool
Any user can escape from paying fees when funding a pool by transferring a lot of times with low amounts.
## Vulnerability Detail
In Allo.sol when a pool is funded a percent fee must be paid to the protocol. Currently, this is how it is calculated:
```solidity
feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
```
Therefore, if the `amount * percentFee` is lower than `getFeeDenominator`(1e18), feeAmount would be equal to 0, due to rounding down. Even though the fee is 0 the transaction would be successful.
For example, if percentFee is 0.1% or 1e15, in order for the user to not pay any fees they would need to send an amount less than 1000. They could then initiate multiple transactions with a low enough fund amount in order to escape from paying any fees.
This would be even more problematic on chains where transaction gas costs are not high.
## Impact
Any user can escape from being feed when funding a pool.

```solidity
if (percentFee > 0) {
    feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
    amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

    _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
}
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revert `fundPool` function if  `feeAmount` is 0.
