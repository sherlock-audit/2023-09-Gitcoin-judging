# Allo#_createPool
In Allo.sol, a `baseFee` is charged when a user creates a pool via `_createPool`. However, when the token is not NATIVE, the user is forced to send more than `baseFee`.

In case the user sends exactly the amount that needs to be paid, the transaction will revert. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's see this check in `_createPool`:
```solidity
function _createPool( ) internal returns (uint256 poolId) {
//unrelated functionality
if (baseFee > 0) {
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
}
```
As you can see from the check `(_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)` if the user sends exactly the value needed, we will enter the `if` and the transaction will revert.

The users will expect to be able to pay the exact amount they need to pay but the current implementation doesn't allow this.
## Impact
The users will always need to send more than required which is not the expected behaviour.

## Recommendation
Change the check to `(_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)`
