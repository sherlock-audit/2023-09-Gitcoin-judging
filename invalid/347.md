# Users can lose funds when creating pool

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            } 
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
```
When creating a pool, the [_createPool()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L415-L485) function checks that(If baseFee > 0)  the msg.value to greater than baseFee + amount. The strictly needed amount for pool creation is baseFee + amount but when msg.value equals baseFee + amount, the function will revert. The user needs to send more amount than necessary, and The excess amount sent by the user won't be returned. Due to that, creating pools will always lead to a loss of funds for users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Do not revert when baseFee + amount equals msg.value.
Or
2. Return the excess amount to users.
