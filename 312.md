# Lack of access control on `setPoolActive` of `RFPSimpleStrategy`
## Summary
The `setPoolActive` function of `RFPSimpleStrategy` is missing access control.

## Vulnerability Detail
[`setPoolActive`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219C1-L222C6) is supposed to be only called by pool manager to toggle the status of the pool. However, this function doesn't have any access control to it, which lets any actor to change the status of the pool.

## Impact
A malicious actor can change the status of the pool.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `_checkOnlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` before `_setPoolActive(_flag)`, or add the `onlyPoolManager` modifier to the function.
