## Recommendation
To enhance transparency a consider emitting an event within the `removePoolManager`  and addPoolManager function to log the removal of a manager from the pool. This event can include relevant information such as the pool ID and the address of the removed manager. Emitting an event will improve visibility into pool management actions.
