# `_createPool` reverts on valid attempts to create a pool with exact fee amount
## Summary
`_createPool` in the Allo contract reverts when provided native ETH is exactly enough to pay `baseFee` causing reverts on valid creation attempts and wasting gas unnecessarily.

## Vulnerability Detail
If `baseFee > 0`, users must pay the base fee (always in native ETH) to create a pool. `_createPool` reverts if `baseFee + _amount >= msg.value` when creating a pool with native ETH as the 'token', or when `baseFee >= msg.value` for an ERC20 token pool.

```solidity
        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
```
This means pool creation will revert even when `msg.value` is sufficient.

## Impact
Since most users will provide the exact fee amount, most initial (valid) creation attempts will fail, unnecessarily wasting gas.
