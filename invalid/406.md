Possible reentrancy attack, where an external malicious contract / some can make multiple calls into the _fundPool function, potentially allowing it to manipulate the contract's state and balances

## Vulnerability Detail
The code is susceptible to reentrancy attacks, where an external malicious contract can make multiple calls into the `_fundPool` function, potentially allowing it to manipulate the contract's state and balances.

The vulnerability arises from the order of operations within the `_fundPool` function. Delibrating down using a code snippet from code to illustrate the issue:

```solidity
function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
    uint256 feeAmount;
    uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

    Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
    address _token = pool.token;

    if (percentFee > 0) {
        feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
        amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

        // Transfer fee to the treasury
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
    }

    // Transfer remaining amount to the strategy
    _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
    _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

    emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
}
```

In this code, the vulnerability lies in the sequence of operations:

1. Fees are deducted from `_amount`.
2. The remaining amount (`amountAfterFee`) is transferred to the strategy.
3. `increasePoolAmount` is called to update the pool's balance.

An attacker can exploit this sequence by creating a malicious strategy contract that reenters the `_fundPool` function after fees are deducted but before `increasePoolAmount` is called. During this reentrancy, the attacker's malicious strategy contract can manipulate the funds' destination, potentially draining the funds intended for the strategy or siphoning off fees.



## Impact
An attacker could drain the funds intended for the strategy or even siphon off fees, leading to a loss of funds for the contract and its users. This is a critical vulnerability that could result in financial losses.

#### Code Example
To illustrate the vulnerability, consider this simplified example of an attacker's malicious strategy contract:

```solidity
contract MaliciousStrategy {
    PoolContract pool;

    constructor(address _poolContract) {
        pool = PoolContract(_poolContract);
    }

    // Malicious reentrancy attack
    function attack() external {
        // Perform reentrancy after fees are deducted but before increasePoolAmount
        pool.fundPool(100); // Calls _fundPool with 100 units, reentering here
        // Manipulate funds or destination at this point
    }
}
```

The attacker's `MaliciousStrategy` contract can initiate a reentrancy attack after fees are deducted but before `increasePoolAmount`, potentially redirecting funds or fees for malicious purposes.

    Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
    address _token = pool.token;

    if (percentFee > 0) {
        feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
        amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

        // Transfer fee to the treasury
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
    }

    // Transfer remaining amount to the strategy
    _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
    _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

    emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
}
```

```solidity
contract MaliciousStrategy {
    PoolContract pool;

    constructor(address _poolContract) {
        pool = PoolContract(_poolContract);
    }

    // Malicious reentrancy attack
    function attack() external {
        // Perform reentrancy after fees are deducted but before increasePoolAmount
        pool.fundPool(100); // Calls _fundPool with 100 units, reentering here
        // Manipulate funds or destination at this point
    }
}
```
