# `batchAllocate` doesn't work with native tokens and `fundPool` doesn't help
## Summary

We can use the `allocate` method with a native token. But when using `batchAllocate` it will revert as `AMOUNT_MISMATCH()` or `INVALID`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `batchAllocate` cannot be used with a native token because is missing the `payable` keyword in the method declaration. Also the logic of a strategy `allocate` method is expecting the exact amount to be passed when used with a native token.

The comment https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L359 says to use `fundPool` but in this method we are restricted to allocate only the pool token in contrast with allocate where we can use any token that is allowed/whitelisted.

## Impact
Users cannot use `batchAllocate` with native tokens

## Recommendation

By changing the following code the batch allocating will work also with native tokens

For the following code to work for every strategy implement `_allocate` that will return the amount and token allocated. Also check that the passed `msg.value` is at least the amount that is parsed from the `data` parameter.

```diff
-function batchAllocate(uint256[] calldata _poolIds, bytes[] memory _datas) external nonReentrant {
+function batchAllocate(uint256[] calldata _poolIds, bytes[] memory _datas) external payable nonReentrant {    
        uint256 numPools = _poolIds.length;

        // Reverts if the length of _poolIds does not match the length of _datas with 'MISMATCH()' error
        if (numPools != _datas.length) revert MISMATCH();

        // Loop through the _poolIds & _datas and call the internal _allocate() function
+        uint256 nativeValue = msg.value;
        for (uint256 i; i < numPools;) {
-            _allocate(_poolIds[i], _datas[i]);
+           (address token, uint256 allocated) = _allocate{value:nativeValue}(_poolIds[i], _datas[i]);
+           if (token == NATIVE) {
+               nativeValue -= allocated
+           }
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }

```
