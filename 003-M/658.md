# `QVSimpleStrategy._allocate()` does not update `allocator.voiceCredits` as expected, causing the upper limit of `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` to be ineffective.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

`maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` is the maximum number of votes allowed for each allocator. This limit is enforced by the check of `_hasVoiceCreditsLeft()`.

However, in the current implementation, the `_allocatedVoiceCredits`, i.e., `allocator.voiceCredits`, was never changed, which means it is always `0`.

As a result, the allocator can only vote up to `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` each time, effectively giving an arbitrary number of votes to the recipient they choose.

## Recommendation

```diff
/// @notice Allocate votes to a recipient
/// @param _data The data
/// @param _sender The sender of the transaction
/// @dev Only the pool manager(s) can call this function
function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal virtual override {
    (address recipientId, uint256 voiceCreditsToAllocate) = abi.decode(_data, (address, uint256));

    // spin up the structs in storage for updating
    Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
    Allocator storage allocator = allocators[_sender];

    // check that the sender can allocate votes
    if (!_isValidAllocator(_sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();

    // check that the recipient is accepted
    if (!_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId)) revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);

    // check that the recipient has voice credits left to allocate
    if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();

+    allocator.voiceCredits += voiceCreditsToAllocate;

    _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
}
