# ```allocator.voiceCredits``` is not changed anywhere
## Summary
```allocator.voiceCredits``` is never decremented through the ```_qv_allocate``` function in QVBaseStrategy.sol contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This essentially gives the allocator infinite voice credits to allocate as many credits as they like to a recipient which in turn can also influence the votes massively.

## Impact
An allocate can repeatedly call the ```_qv_allocate``` function from QVBaseStrategy.sol repeatedly without their ```voiceCredits``` value decreasing, giving recipients a larger number of ```voiceCreditsCastToRecipient```as well as ```votesCastToRecipient```, meaning their influence on how the pools funds are distributed are favoured largely towards them.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Where the storage values are updated in the ```_qv_allocate`` function in QVBaseStrategy.sol add the following line:

```_allocator.voiceCredits -= _voiceCreditsToAllocate``` in order to decrement the voice credits of the allocator by how much they are allocating in the transaction.
