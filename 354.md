# Off by one error forces pool creator to send excess ETH
## Summary

An off by one error in Allo.sol enforces that the msg.value provided in `_createPool` is strictly greater than the amount to actually be used to pay fees and fund the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `Allo._createPool`, there exists a revert which reverts if the amount of ETH used in the transaction (just baseFee if not funding the pool with ETH, or baseFee + amount if funding with ETH) is greater than or equal to the msg.value provided. This means that execution will revert unless the msg.value is strictly greater than the amount to be used in the transaction. As a result, when passing the msg.value correctly, users will be left with a costly revert (they have to pay all the gas up to this point), and to successfuly create the pool, they must pass more msg.value than will be used, not receiving that amount back.

## Impact

Users pool creation transactions will revert unless they send more ETH along with their transaction then will be used.

```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
    revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Execution should only revert if the msg.value is not strictly equal to the required amount to be used. e.g.:

```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount != msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee != msg.value)) {
    revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
}
```
