# `QVSimpleStrategy`: part of the distribution may be locked when allocation and registration overlap

While the registration is open, the recipient's status can change from Accepted to other statuses
via `QVBaseStrategy::reviewRecipients` or `registerRecipient`.
Upon `QVSimpleStrategy::_allocate`, it checks whether the recipient is accepted.
Normally, it will work okay if there is no overlap of registration and allocation.
But if there is an overlap, the funds allocated to the recipients, who later changed not being accepted will be locked.


## Vulnerability Detail

Pool timestamps for registration and allocation are checked and updated via `QVBaseStrategy::_updatePoolTimestamps`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L342-L348

According to the check, the timestamp should be:

```solidity
// QVBaseStrategy::_updatePoolTimestamps
341         // validate the timestamps for this strategy
342         if (
343             block.timestamp > _registrationStartTime || _registrationStartTime > _registrationEndTime
344                 || _registrationStartTime > _allocationStartTime || _allocationStartTime > _allocationEndTime
345                 || _registrationEndTime > _allocationEndTime
346         ) {
347             revert INVALID();
348         }
```

Which can translates into:

```markdown
block.timestamp =< registrationStartTime =< registrationEndTime =< allocationEndTime
                   registrationStartTime =< allocationStartTime =< allocationEndTime
```

Therefore, the check does not prohibits the overlap of registration and allocation.


When the registration is open, there are two ways to change the status of the recipients:
1. a member or the owner of a profile can call `registerRecipient`
  - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L414-L426
  - change from `None` to `Pending`, `Accepted` to `Pending`, or `Rejected` to `Appealed`
2. the pool manager can call `QVBaseStrategy::reviewRecipients` to change the status.
  - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L277
  - it will change the status based on the vote


When the allocation is open, the valid allocators can allocate via `Allo::allocate`.
The Allo will then call `BaseStrategy::allocate`, which will call the `QVSimpleStrategy::_allocate`, then `QVBaseStrategy::_qv_allocate`.
The `QVBaseStrategy::_qv_allocate` will add votes to the `_recipient.totalVotesReceived`.
The `_recipient.totalVotesReceived` will be used to calculate how much the recipient will be paid in `QVBaseStrategy::_getPayout`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L526-L527
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L571

Note that the `QVBaseStrategy::totalRecipientVotes` is also updated, so that the sum of the `totalVotesReceived` for each recipient will result in the `totalRecipientVotes`. In the `QVBaseStrategy::_getPayout` function the portion of the each recipients `totalRecipientVotes` against the `totalVotesReceived` is calculated. So, if any of the recipient cannot get paid, the share of the recipient will be locked. Also the `QVSimpleStrategy`, `QVBaseStrategy` and `BaseStrategy` do not implement a function to recover the leftover funds.

When the funds are distributed via `Allo::distribute` function, the `QVBaseStrategy::_distribute` reverts if the recipient is not accepted:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L451-L453


In summary, if some votes are cast to some recipients via `Allo::allocate` while they were accepted, and later their status changed, the portion of funds for the votes will be locked.


## Impact

The funds allocated to recipients, whose status changes from accepted to another status, will be locked.

## Recommendation

Consider disallowing the time overlap between registration and allocation.
