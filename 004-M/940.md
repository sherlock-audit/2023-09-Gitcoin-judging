# RFPSimpleStrategy: submitting proposal will always revert
## Summary

Submitting proposal will always revert in case of `useRegistryAnchor` flag is true due to the check at the line L#362

## Vulnerability Detail

There is a check which reverts when `recipientAddress == address(0)` at the line L#362 in the `RFPSimpleStrategy._registerRecipient` function. But the `recipientAddress` variable is always zero when `useRegistryAnchor` flag is true. So the `_registerRecipient` function will always revert and the contract functionality will be broken.
```solidity
321        address recipientAddress;

326        // Decode '_data' depending on the 'useRegistryAnchor' flag
327        if (useRegistryAnchor) {
328            /// @custom:data when 'true' -> (address recipientId, uint256 proposalBid, Metadata metadata)
329            (recipientId, proposalBid, metadata) = abi.decode(_data, (address, uint256, Metadata));
330
331            // If the sender is not a profile member this will revert
332            if (!_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
333        } else {

362        if (recipientAddress == address(0)) revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
```  

## Impact

Submitting proposal will always revert in case of `useRegistryAnchor` flag is true due to the check at the line L#362. The contract functionality will be broken.

## Recommendation

Consider adding a correct address to the `recipientAddress` variable if  the `useRegistryAnchor` flag is true.
