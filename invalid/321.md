# fundPool could be reentered before state is updated, allowing double deposits.
## Summary
There is a reentrancy vulnerability in the fundPool function where it could be reentered before state is updated, allowing double deposits.
## Vulnerability Detail
It first transfers tokens to the strategy, then calls the external strategy contract to update state.
However, a malicious strategy could call back into fundPool() before its state is updated, duplicating the deposit.

The external call to the strategy to increase the pool amount happens before the state is updated.
This allows the following attack:
1. Attacker calls fundPool with 10 tokens
2. fundPool transfers 10 tokens
3. Strategy callback function calls back into fundPool with 10 more tokens
4. fundPool allows this since nonReentrant only prevents reentry in the same call frame
5. Attacker has now deposited 20 tokens instead of 10

## Impact
Loss of funds due to double/multiple deposits
