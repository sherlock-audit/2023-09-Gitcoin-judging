# Distribution is possible during allocation
Due to an incorrect active allocation check, distribution can happen during allocation time. This can distribute payouts to users incorrectly and unfairly. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Distribution can happen during allocation when `block.timestamp == allocationEndTime`.

Allocation is active when `allocationStartTime <= block.timestamp <= allocationEndTime`.
```solidity
    /// @notice Check if the allocation is active
    /// @dev Reverts if the allocation is not active
    function _checkOnlyActiveAllocation() internal view virtual {
        if (allocationStartTime > block.timestamp || block.timestamp > allocationEndTime) {
            revert ALLOCATION_NOT_ACTIVE();
        }
    }
```

The `_checkOnlyAfterAllocation` considers allocation to have ended if `block.timestamp == allocationEndTime` even though the above `_checkOnlyActiveAllocation` check considers is as still active. 
```solidity
    /// @notice Check if the allocation has ended
    /// @dev Reverts if the allocation has not ended
    function _checkOnlyAfterAllocation() internal view virtual {
        if (block.timestamp < allocationEndTime) revert ALLOCATION_NOT_ENDED();
    }
```

The payouts will be incorrectly distributed. 

Here's an example using the `QVSimpleStrategy` strategy:

For simplicity, let's assume the `poolAmount = 100`.

1. Alice allocated 10 votes and Bob allocated 5 votes.
2. Pool manager distributes tokens to Alice and Bob at `block.timestamp == allocationEndTime`. According to the `_getPayout` calculation, Alice gets (10/15) 66.66% of the pool amount and (5/15) Bob gets 33.33%. All `poolAmount` is sent.

```solidity
function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
{
   ...
   amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
   return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
}
```
3. Another user Chris allocates 5 votes at `block.timestamp == allocationEndTime`.
4. Pool manager distributes the tokens to Chris. Chris is supposed to get (5/20) 25% of the poolAmount. This may fail if the poolAmount is depleted. 

Alice and Bob is getting an unfair amount of tokens when the actual distribution should be:
* Alice (10/20) = 50%
* Bob (5/20) = 25%
* Chris (5/20) = 25%

## Impact
Users who allocated before the distribution will get a higher incorrect payout amount than users who allocated after the distribution. The users also may not get their payout if the poolAmount was depleted to all the users who allocated before the distribution. 

This bug affects all contracts that have the incorrect implementation of `_checkOnlyActiveAllocation`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the `allocationEndTime` comparison check to be inclusive. 
```solidity
    function _checkOnlyActiveAllocation() internal view virtual {
        --> if (allocationStartTime > block.timestamp || block.timestamp >= allocationEndTime) { <--
            revert ALLOCATION_NOT_ACTIVE();
        }
    }
```
