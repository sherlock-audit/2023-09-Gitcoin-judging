# Allo#_createPool would revert in case of correct msg.value

`Allo#_createPool` would revert in case of correct `msg.value`

## Vulnerability Detail

In case if `baseFee` value is greater than 0, the `_createPool` functions would check if the current `msg.value` is enough to pay the fee and fund pool in the case of the `NATIVE` token. However comparing statement is wrongly reverted in case `msg.value` is accurate to the paying amounts (line 473), while it should revert only if `msg.value` is not enough to cover payment.

## Impact

`Allo#_createPool` would revert in case of correct `msg.value`

## Code Snippet

File: Allo.sol
473:             if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) { 
474:                 revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
475:             }
```

## Recommendation

Consider updating comparing statements to `>` instead of `>=` at line 473.
