# Funds sent to the Anchor contract are lost forever
## Summary
The Anchor contract can receive native token but does not implement the means to withdraw or collect it, meaning all funds are stuck in the contract permanently
```solidity
  /// @notice This contract should be able to receive native token
    receive() external payable {}
}
```

## Vulnerability Detail
Anchors in the Allo protocol are associated with profiles and are accessible exclusively by the profile owner. The `receive()` function is called automatically when tokens are sent and `msg.data` is empty

## Impact
This is a medium vulnerability that can lead to loss of funds sent to the contract

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Most contracts that have receive() or fallback functions implement a `withdraw()` or `recoverFunds()` function to pull out the native tokens in the contract. This would fix the issue.
