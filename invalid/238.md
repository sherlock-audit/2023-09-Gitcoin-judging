# BatchAllocate cannot work with some strategies if the token is native

The function batchallocate cannot work with some strategies if the token is native 

## Vulnerability Detail

The function Batch Allocate allows a user to allocate funds to multiple pools.

 However the function is not payable which presents a problem as a pool can be funded with Native tokens. This is evident in the nested function _allocate 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L493

The function expects to receive native tokens in the event that a pool uses them but it will not work 


## Impact

The function batchallocate will not work if the pool uses native tokens

## Recommendation

Adjust the function Batch Allocate to work with strategies that use Native token or make it clear in the comments/documentation that the function cannot be used with native tokens
