# Creating a pool always requires an excess amount of ETH
## Summary
If baseFee is enabled, the calculation for it requires msg.value to always be higher than actually needed
## Vulnerability Detail
In `Allo._createPool`, baseFee mechanism:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L469-L474
Both conditions requires to be >= to msg.value. 
Meaning, if we sent exactly the amount needed, it will revert thus always requiring a higher amount.
## Impact
Pool creatooor will ways require an excess amount of ETH to be sent for the baseFee

## Recommendation
Change the require statement to the following
```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
```
