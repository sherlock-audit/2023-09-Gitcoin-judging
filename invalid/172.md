# In RFPSimpleStrategy, too little is paid for milestones past the first

RFPSimpleStrategy._distribute distributes a percentage of the amount of funds *currently remaining in the pool*. This means that e.g.: if there are two milestones of 50% each, the first milestone will pay 50%, and the second will pay 50% of the remaining 50%, leaving 25% in the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Alice creates a pool using the RFPSimpleStrategy, with two milestone for 50% each
2. Bob submits a winning bid for 10K USDC. 
3. Alice accepts Bob's bid and funds the pool to 10K USDC.
4. Bob completes the first milestone and Alice calls _distribute. Bob gets paid 5K USDC. Now poolAmount is 5000e18.
5. Bob completes the first milestone and Alice calls _distribute. However, Bob only gets paid 5k USDC.

6. As a result, Bob is not paid in full for the second milestone. 

Further, if Alice withdraws the remaining funds, Alice permanently loses the fees charged by the protocol. 

## Impact

RFPSimpleStrategy pools with multiple milestones do not work.
