# Lack of events emission after sensitive actions
The Allo project codebase exhibits cases where sensitive operations are performed without emitting corresponding events.
## Vulnerability Detail
Throughout the codebase, there are instances where key actions are taken without emitting necessary events. Specifically, in the following contract:
Allo.sol:
- `addPoolManager` function lacks emission of `RoleGranted()` event.
```solidity
/// @dev Emits 'RoleGranted()' event. 'msg.sender' must be a pool admin.
```
- `removePoolManager` function lacks emission of `RoleRevoked()` event.
```solidity
/// @dev Emits 'RoleRevoked()' event. 'msg.sender' must be a pool admin.
```
## Impact
Both Users and Issuers would possibly be unaware of critical changes in the protocol.

Manual Review
## Recommendation
Emit the event mentioned in the NatSpec comments of `Allo.addPoolManager` and `Allo.removePoolManager` to report critical changes.
