# `setPoolActive` in `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` can be called by anyone which can be used to DoS the whole strategy contract
It is stated in the comments that `setPoolActive` must only be called by the pool manager to close it, but there is no modifier or protection on the function, so it can be called by anyone to close or open it, all the time.
## Vulnerability Detail
As can be seen here only the pool manager should be able to call `setPoolActive` and close the pool

but no protection or modifier is on the function, the function is external and can be called by anyone

setting the pool to active or inactive at any time, which can be used to DoS the whole contract block the funds.
## Impact
Impact is a high one since the function can be called any time to close the pool or open the pool right before any actions, which will DoS the whole system.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use a modifier on the function to check if the caller is the owner, don't let anyone call the function to close or open the pool as he wants.
