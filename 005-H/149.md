# QVBaseStrategy.sol - voiceCreditsCastToRecipient is updated adding more credit than actually allocated
## Summary
Under function _**_qv_allocate**_, the mapping _**voiceCreditsCastToRecipient**_ is updated erroneously by adding more credit than it has actually allocated.

## Vulnerability Detail
Under function _**_qv_allocate**_, the mapping _**voiceCreditsCastToRecipient**_ is updated by adding the voice credits allocated (_**_voiceCreditsToAllocate**_). It, however, updates _**voiceCreditsCastToRecipient**_ by adding **_totalCredits_** which already contains _**creditsCastToRecipient**_ so adding it twice.

Let's assume that _**recipientId**_ gets allocated 4 voice credits. If we check the mapping(address => uint256) _**voiceCreditsCastToRecipient**_ within the allocator - _**allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[recipientId]**_, it wil yield 4.
Let's assume now that _**recipientId**_ gets allocated 1 voice credit more from the same allocator. The mapping _**voiceCreditsCastToRecipient**_  will now yield 9. The previous amount is added twice (i.e. 4 + 4 +1)

## Impact
The Allocator will have more credits allocated to a given recipient than it was actually allocated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update LOC529 with:
_**_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += _voiceCreditsToAllocate;**_
