# revert INVALID_MILESTONE() is checking after the milestones.push()
revert INVALID_MILESTONE() is checking after the milestones.push()

## Vulnerability Detail
The check  if (totalAmountPercentage != 1e18) revert INVALID_MILESTONE() is after pushing the milestones.push(_milestones[i]);
The check for totalAmountPercentage != 1e18 should be done before pushing the milestone or else there is no point of checking it.

## Impact
milestones will be set even if totalAmountPercentage is not equal to 1e18

## Recommendation
The check for totalAmountPercentage != 1e18 should be done before pushing the milestone or else there is no point of checking it.
