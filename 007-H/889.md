# The registry is set to a wrong address in the Anchor constructor.
## Summary

When a user creates a profile an Anchor is deployed using CREATE3. In the Anchor constructor the registry is then set to msg.sender however when using CREATE3 the msg.sender of the child contract is not the deployer but the temporary proxy contract used by CREATE3.

## Vulnerability Detail

The registry in the Anchor constructor is wrongly set to the msg.sender which is the temporary proxy contract and not the the registry contract.

This is also mentioned in this [create3 factory ](https://github.com/ZeframLou/create3-factory#usage):

>The deployed contract should be aware that msg.sender in the constructor will be the temporary proxy contract used by CREATE3 rather than the deployer, so common patterns like Ownable should be modified to accomodate for this.

## Impact

The registry address will be a completely different address and when calling execute() the tx will revert so if a user sends funds to the Anchor then his funds will be stuck because there is no way for him to get them back because execute() will always fail. 

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/core/Anchor.sol#L56


To test this you can add these 3 lines at the end of the `test_createProfile()` in `core/Registry.t.sol` and as you can see the addresses will be different. 

```solidity
function test_createProfile() public {
   ...

   Registry deployedAnchor = Anchor(payable(profile.anchor)).registry();

   console.log("The registry from the deployed anchor is", address(deployedAnchor));
   console.log("The real registry address is", address(registry()));
   
}
```


## Tool used

Manual Review + Foundry

## Recommendation

Dont use msg.sender and instead pass in the address of the registry as an argument

```solidity
constructor(bytes32 _profileId, address _registry) {
        registry = Registry(_registry);
        profileId = _profileId;
    }
```
