# Using tokens with a transfer fee may result in the loss of funds of recent users
The Allo._fundPool() function calculates the number of tokens that will go to the pool account after deducting the commission:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L502C5-L520

After deducting the commission, amountAfterFee is sent to the _strategy address:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L517
_transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));

In this case, the _strategy.increasePoolAmount() function is called, which increases the variable to count the number of tokens at the strategy address:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L153-L157
function increasePoolAmount(uint256 _amount) external override onlyAllo {
     _beforeIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
     poolAmount += _amount;
     _afterIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
}

However, there are tokens that have a transfer fee: https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer.
If a token with a transfer fee is used as _tokens, this will result in the strategy address receiving fewer tokens than amountAfterFee.

In the future, when sending tokens, the last users will not receive tokens.

## Recommendation
In strategy contracts, check the balance before tokens are credited to the balance and after. The difference is added to poolAmount.
