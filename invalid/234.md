# Pool could be created with a strategy, which does not implement BaseStrategy
In Allo docs we have `Expects a strategy which implements BaseStrategy.sol` `Expects all interactions with the functions on BaseStrategys.sol to happen via Allo.sol`, but this is not guaranteed, because inside Allo.sol and everywhere else strategy address is being cast to "IStrategy", which could be contract, which does not implement BaseStrategy and this breaks protocol invariant assumption that every strategy implements BaseStrategy.sol.
## Vulnerability Detail
Someone could create malicious implementation of IStrategy.sol interface and register a pool inside Allo.sol. 
Even if the actor is not malicious and create Strategy implementation focusing on the custom logic and forget to implement logic that the contract could be initialized only once. This could result in major bad circumstances, if the pool with this strategy is registered once, than some allocation/distribution interactions has passed and then the same address is passed to create another pool. If the logic inside BaseContract.sol regarding "only one initialization" is not implemented from this strategy... big confusion will arise when a second initilization is called. Recipients data would be erased, pool amount will be changed etc, which could also result in users lost funds.
## Impact
- Unpredictable behaviour.
- Potential fund loss

## Recommendation
Use `BaseStrategy` for type casting to assure the provided implementation use BaseStrategy.sol
