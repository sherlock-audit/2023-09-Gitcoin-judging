# using SafeTransfeEth causing a greifing attack by the receving contract
## Summary
if the `receipintAddress` is an attacker or smart contract and it leaves over 1/64 gas which causes the dos 
## Vulnerability Detail
since we are using a  not gas limit version of transferring eth the recipient address can gas grief as explained by the  solady [library](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/72e76e222a586bb6061bf09d9dcaa3c50c92a2dd/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol#L9)
so when we do actions in allo we can cause reverts or maybe even dos  attacks 
## Impact
1. we can just cause reverts attacks on `_distribute` or `_allocate` if using eth 
2. `_distribute#rfpCommittee` will revert if doing the 1/64 gas left attack since we are updating 2 state vars which can be a lot of gas 
and if there is a long vote process that takes over a year it will cause dos/startegy to be stuck.
an attacker can do a small milestone and very small ProposalBid so the pool Manager accepts him.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L439
```solidity
//_distribute
    _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

        // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;

        // Increment the upcoming milestone
        upcomingMilestone++;
```
```solidity
   function _transferAmountFrom(address _token, TransferData memory _transferData) internal returns (bool) {
        uint256 amount = _transferData.amount;
        if (_token == NATIVE) {
            // Native Token
            if (msg.value < amount) revert AMOUNT_MISMATCH();

            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_transferData.to, amount);
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
should use ` function forceSafeTransferETH(address to, uint256 amount, uint256 gasStipend) internal {` and use gas limit  or do pull method of receiving funds like `claim`
a proper gaslimit=`8000`
