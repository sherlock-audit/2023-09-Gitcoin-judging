# Unrestricted Access to setPoolActive Function
## Summary
The `setPoolActive` function in the contract lacks `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` access controls.

## Vulnerability Detail
The setPoolActive function in the code below allows any external caller to set the pool's active status:
```solidity
    /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
As you can see in the comments it should be restricted by `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` access control.
This function directly interacts with the _setPoolActive function from the BaseStrategy contract to change the active status of the pool.

## Impact
Anyone can (by front-running or simply) : 

1. Interrupt the allocation process by deactivating the pool at critical stages.
2. Manipulate the voting strategy by continuously toggling the active status of the pool.
3. Potentially block recipients from receiving their allocations by preventing the pool from being set inactive.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Here is a revised version of the setPoolActive function with an onlyPoolManager modifier:
```solidity
function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) { 
    _setPoolActive(_flag); 
    emit PoolActive(_flag);
}
```
