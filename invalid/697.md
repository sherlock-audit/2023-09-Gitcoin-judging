# ETH could be left stuck during allocation within strategies
ETH could be left stuck during allocation within strategies

## Vulnerability Detail
Allocation hooks transfers the allocated tokens to the recipients or to the vault but `AMOUNT_MISMATCH` allows for excess `msg.value` to passed in then supplied amount would be sent either to the recipient or to the vault depending on the strategy.
This loose check allows ETH to stuck within the contract.
For Instance:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-distribution-direct-transfer/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionDirectTransferStrategy.sol#L54
```solidity
function _afterAllocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal override {
        ...SNIP
        if (token == NATIVE) {
@>           if (msg.value < amount) {
                revert AMOUNT_MISMATCH();
            }
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_recipients[recipientId].recipientAddress, amount);<@
        } else {
          ...SNIP
        }
    }
```
This allows `msg.value` to be greater than `amount` but amount is the value sent to either the recipient or the vault the excess would remain stuck within the contract.

## Recommendation
Revert if `msg.value != amount`
