# Milestone distribution likely gets DoS'd in RFPSimpleStrategy
## Summary

Logic used to validate remaining funds being sufficient to cover distribution is incorrectly implemented, resulting in the likely inability to distribute funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Milestones can only be set once in the life of the contract and must add up to a total amountPercentage of 1e18 (100%). The same recipient proposalBid applies to multiple milestones, splitting the payout amount between them according to their amount percentages. When distributing, the recipient receives a percentage of the proposalBid after validating that the proposalBid is <= poolAmount. In future milestones though, the poolAmount will be lower while the proposalBid will remain the same, causing `_distribute` to revert if the **total** `proposalBid` exceeds the **remaining** `poolAmount`.

## Impact

`_distribute` will likely revert for later milestones.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// @audit reverts if total proposalBid is > remaining poolAmount
if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();

// Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;

// Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
poolAmount -= amount;
_transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of reverting if `recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount`, we should only revert if `amount > poolAmount`, e.g.:

```solidity
// Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;

// Only revert if amount to distribute exceeds poolAmount
if (amount > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
```
