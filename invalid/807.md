# since `poolAmount` in `_distribute#QVbaseStrategy` is not updated it can cause reverts and break in functionillity
`poolAmount` is not updated in `_distribute` so if someone has a certain amount of earned funds they will not get it 
## Vulnerability Detail
Firstly take this ex:
`poolBalance=1000`
Alice will get `(1000 * (5/10))=500`  since he got 5 votes out of 10 
Sam will get `(1000*(7/10))=700`  since he got 7 out of the 10 votes 
both will be 1200 which is greater than the funds in the contract 
2 things.
1.  since PoolAmount is not updated  and if the contract only has the `balance == poolAmount` it will cause reverts 
2. if poolAmount is updated before this call by a supporter  one of the recipients  will get more than the other even with fewer votes 
ex: `200 * 0.5=100` and `1000 * 0.2=200` 
## Impact
A.mostly PoolAmount will revert and not allow rightful votees to get their funds so the contract admins will have to `updateTimestamps` which can take time/opportunity cost to get votes voted than before.Plus it Dosnt stop the revert from happening since in future votes the same thing can happen with the ratios and poolAmount.

B.If a supporter updates this call before this is a break in logic of how the contract works enabling an attack vector that some attacker can work with votee on the inside and get more funds
## Code Snippet

```solidity
// @audit as we can see we are using an old PoolAmount that is not updated 
 function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (PayoutSummary memory)
    {
        Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];

        // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
        uint256 amount;
        if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
            amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
        }
        return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
    }
// _distribute
// @audit it going to use the outdated  amount causing reverts or more tokens to be given to the user 
  PayoutSummary memory payout = _getPayout(recipientId, "");
            uint256 amount = payout.amount;

            if (paidOut[recipientId] || !_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId) || amount == 0) {
                revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
            }

            IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
            _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

            paidOut[recipientId] = true;

            emit Distributed(recipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update PoolAmount in `_distribute`
to only allow the left over funds to be used for _distribute so their is no advantage for the impacts above
```solidity
poolAmount-=amount
```
