# funding of `QVSimpleStrategy.sol` is impossibe since it doesn't have `receive()` function for eth
The QVSimpleStrategy.sol contract currently lacks a receive() function, which means it cannot receive funds directly. Funding for this strategy is typically done by calling the Allo.fundPool() function.in which underhood uses SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH() if eth is chosen
## Vulnerability Detail
Allo protocol, the typical way to fund a strategy is by using the Allo.fundPool() function. Users or smart contracts interact with the Allo contract to provide funds for a pool, and the Allo contract is responsible for distributing those funds to the associated strategy. the QVSimpleStrategy.sol contract cannot receive ether directly because Allo.fundPool() uses SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH() to transfer eth 
## Impact
The absence of a receive() function in the `QVSimpleStrategy.sol` contract directly impact the functioning of the strategy , if someone attempts to send Ether using Allo.fundPool() to the QVSimpleStrategy.sol contract, the transaction will fail, and the funds will not be stored in strategy as intended. U.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }

## Recommendation
add `receive()` function
