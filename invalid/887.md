# Calling `execute()` can incur high expense as the data length is not checked while `_target.call`
In `execute()`, `_data` is used to send data to the target address. But the length of the data is not checked while calling `_target.call` function. This could result in huge gas costs & sometimes even maybe exceeding the value to be sent resulting in denial of service.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: Anchor.sol

78:          (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_data);
```
## Impact
If the length of `_data` is too long, the call will fail leading to a revert even if all the parameters are correctly passed when calling the `execute()`.

## Recommendation
Check the length of the data to be sent before executing.
