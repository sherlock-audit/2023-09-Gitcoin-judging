# Risk of losing fund when Excessive Native Token amount is mistakenly sent by Pool creator
Native Token Fund will be lost when Excessive Native Token amount is mistakenly sent by Pool creator to contract when creating pool due to the validation at [L473](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L473) which allows msg.value to be higher than amount needed.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  function _createPool(
        bytes32 _profileId,
        IStrategy _strategy,
        bytes memory _initStrategyData,
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        Metadata memory _metadata,
        address[] memory _managers
    ) internal returns (uint256 poolId) {
        ...
        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
 >>>>>       if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
...
}
```
as pointed from the code above the validation `baseFee+_amount  >= msg.value`  and `baseFee >= msg.value` , shows that even if msg.value is excessive the function execution will still go through thereby trapping the Native Token amount in the contract.
### Proof of Concept
```solidity
   function test_createPoolWithBaseFee() public {
        uint256 baseFee = 1e17;

        allo().updateBaseFee(baseFee);

        vm.expectEmit(true, false, false, true);
        emit BaseFeePaid(1, baseFee);

        vm.deal(address(pool_admin()), 1e23);

        vm.prank(pool_admin());
      allo().createPoolWithCustomStrategy{value: 1e23}( // value is excessively above baseFee required
            poolProfile_id(), strategy, "0x", NATIVE, 0, metadata, pool_managers()
        );
    } 
```
as seen from the test code above when `value` is set to 1e23 which is excessively above `baseFee`  and the functions pass through there by trapping the excess fund in the contract
## Impact
Loss of Fund due to entrapment in the contract

## Recommendation
```solidity
function _createPool(
        bytes32 _profileId,
        IStrategy _strategy,
        bytes memory _initStrategyData,
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        Metadata memory _metadata,
        address[] memory _managers
    ) internal returns (uint256 poolId) {
        ...
        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
 ---      if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
+++      if ((_token == NATIVE && !(baseFee + _amount == msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && !(baseFee == msg.value))) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
...
}
```
As seen above revert the code when msg.value is not in direct equal balance to the amount needed
