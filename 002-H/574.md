# Denial of service by controlling pool active/inactive status can lock funds in RFP allocation strategy contracts
## Summary
The [RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive() function](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219) has no authorization check so an attacker is able to open or close the pool at will, disrupting contract functionality.

## Vulnerability Detail
The BaseStrategy contract has a `poolActive` boolean storage variable and an internal `_setPoolActive()` function for modifying it. It leaves it up to inheriting implementations to use this and protect it if made externally available. The documented intent is that only an account with "pool manager" permissions should be able to change this variable. However, the RFPSimpleStrategy contract provides an externally callable `setPoolActive()` function that is not restricted to pool manager accounts. As a result, an attacker can call this function to control the status of the pool. 

The active / inactive status of the pool affects fundamental operations of the contract:

1. RFP "recipients" can only register their bids when the pool is **active**.
2. The winning bid can only be accepted when the pool is **active**.
3. Funds can only be distributed to the accepted recipient when the pool is **inactive**.
4. A pool manager can only call `withdraw()` to recover pool funds (e.g. in case of a failed RFP) if the pool is **inactive**.

An attacker can therefore block the bidding & acceptance steps by closing the pool prematurely, or much worse, block distribution / recovery of funds by reopening the pool. The attacker can automatically repeat the interference (by detecting the `PoolActive` event emitted upon changes) each time anyone attempts to reverse it, forming an effective denial of service (DoS) attack that is cheap for the attacker, costing only gas fees.

This affects RFPSimpleStrategy and, by inheritance, RFPCommitteeStrategy.

## Impact
An attacker can interfere with pool operations by:

1. Closing the pool prematurely, denying users from registering or being accepted as RFP recipients.
2. Reopening pool after allocation begins, preventing pool managers from calling `distribute()` and `withdraw()`, effectively locking funds in the contract.

## Code Snippet
The [RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive() function](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219) does not require caller to be a pool manager (despite comment):
```solidity
    /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
The inherited internal function [BaseStrategy._setPoolActive()](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L273C1-L279C6) likewise does not require caller to be a pool manager:
```solidity
    /// @notice Set the pool to active or inactive status.
    /// @dev This will emit a 'PoolActive()' event. Used by the strategy implementation.
    /// @param _active The status to set, 'true' means active, 'false' means inactive
    function _setPoolActive(bool _active) internal {
        poolActive = _active;
        emit PoolActive(_active);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Add the `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` modifier to the [RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive() function](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219).
