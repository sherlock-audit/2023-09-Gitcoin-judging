# Incorrect check for basefee and amount in `createPool`
## Summary
Incorrect check for basefee and amount when creating pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users can create new pool and pay a `baseFee` to treasury and fund the pool with desired `amount`.
The issue is how this baseFee and supplied amount is checked. if the user provides the exact amount the function would revert due to an incorrect check which also goes contrary to the comments.
```solidity
function _createPool(
        bytes32 _profileId,
        IStrategy _strategy,
        bytes memory _initStrategyData,
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        Metadata memory _metadata,
        address[] memory _managers
    ) internal returns (uint256 poolId) {
	...SNIP

        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {//@audit-issue this would always fail for exact amount
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }

        ...SNIP
    }
```
As seen in the comments the intention is to check baseFee should be >= msg.value but the if condition makes the equality check to revert.
Since users would mostly pass in `baseFee` + `amount`, this would always revert, forcing users to overpay.

## Impact
Pool creation would revert when users send the exact and intended value, forcing users to overstate their payment.
