# Funds will lost if treasury is blacklisted

Funds will lost if treasury is blacklisted 

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens have blacklisted functions and If this address is blacklisted by the token then address becomes unable to make transfers, leading to funds being stuck in the address indefinitely.

whenever new pool is created or someone send funds to pool , base fee and other transfer Fee send to `treasury` address

```solidity
File: contracts/core/Allo.sol
[...............]
476    _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
[..............]
516    _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
```

## Recommendation
Implement withdraw pattern as currently protocol recover funds to any address. Apply similar pattern to deduct fee whenever pool is created or pool are funded.
