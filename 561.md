# Even if msg.value is sufficient to cover the baseFee, it may still result in the failure of pool creation
## Summary
Even if msg.value is sufficient to cover the baseFee, it may still result in the failure of pool creation

## Vulnerability Detail
To prevent deducting the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance, the comparison is done between the sum of baseFee + _amount and msg.value, or just between baseFee and msg.value if _token is not equal to NATIVE. However, if msg.value is equal to baseFee + _amount, it should be considered valid. An invalid condition occurs only when baseFee + _amount > msg.value.

Additionally, the above checks should also be performed when baseFee is not set to prevent paying the pool fund from the Allo contract's balance.

## Impact
1. Even if msg.value is sufficient to cover the baseFee, it may still result in the failure of pool creation.
2.  Pool fund may be payed from the Allo contract's balance.

## Recommendation
change to
```solidity
        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        } else {
             if ((_token == NATIVE) && (_amount > msg.value))
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
        }
```
