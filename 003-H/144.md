# Untracked voice credit allocation in QVSimpleStrategy
## Summary
The `_allocate` function from QVSimpleStrategy contract checks if an allocator doesn't exceed the maximum allowed voice credits per allocation (`maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`). This check is accomplished using the `_hasVoiceCreditsLeft` function. However, while the function checks whether the allocator has credits left, there's no mechanism updating or tracking the total voice credits already allocated by the allocator (`allocator.voiceCredits`). Hence, this value remains unchanged, which could lead to unlimited allocations by an allocator.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_allocate` function includes a check which ensures that the allocator has sufficient voice credits remaining. The `_hasVoiceCreditsLeft` function checks if the sum of `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` and `allocator.voiceCredits` is less than or equal to `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator.`

```solidity
        // check that the recipient has voice credits left to allocate
        if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();
```
Next, the function calls the `_qv_allocate` function from QVBaseStrategy. While the `voiceCreditsToAllocate` reflects the credits intended to be allocated during the current transaction, `allocator.voiceCredits` (representing the allocator's total voice credits used so far) never gets updated. As a result, `allocator.voiceCredits` will always remain at its default value, which is 0.


## Impact
Allocators can keep allocating voice credits beyond their allowed maximum limit (`maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`), which can distort the voting results or allocation results.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
After each allocation, ensure that the `voiceCredits` attribute of the Allocator struct is updated with the number of voice credits allocated.
