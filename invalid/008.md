# Users funds can get stuck forever inside Allo contract

The ```Registry.recoverFunds()``` function allow the ALLO_OWNER role detentor to withdraw any funds balance from allo to the recipient. However Funds can get stuck forever in the contract, if the role detentor account owner loses access to his wallet for whatever reasons.
## Vulnerability Detail

The ```Registry.recoverFunds()``` function allow the ALLO_OWNER role detentor to withdraw any funds balance from allo to the recipient. Due to the way openzeppelin access control works the owner account can not grant ALLO_OWNER role to a new account because owner does not grand himself the ```DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE``` from  OZ AccessControl during deployment.

## Impact

Funds can get stuck forever in the contract if owner loses access to his wallet due to any inconvenience: 
-death of the owner,
-wallet compromised,
etc...

Let's see it in live action:

if owner try to grant ALLO_OWNER role to a new account transaction will revert with the following error:
```solidity
"AccessControl: account 0x5b38da6a701c568545dcfcb03fcb875f56beddc4 is missing role 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", (which is the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE).
```

// he can't. Same thing if he loses access to his wallet.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
owner should grant himself Oz DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE at deployment, so he can get full access control and grant role to new accounts if the current one is compromised
