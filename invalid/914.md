# when creating a pool, users are forced to overpay basefee
When creating a pool, users are forced to overpay the basefee
## Vulnerability Detail
in the function `_createPool`. we see this logic.
```solidity
        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
```
The problem with the logic above is that when the `_token` is not NATIVE, users are forced to overpay the `baseFee`

```solidity
(_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value))
```
this is where the problem is, if token is not native and baseFee is greater than or equal to msg.value, the call will revert. This is not correct because if a user  sets msg.value to the basefee, his tx will revert.  

POC

1. user wants to create pool
2. user calls `_createPool` with an erc 20 as the token, not NATIVE
3. The base fee is 100 so user sets the msg.value to 100.
4. because of this incorrect check, `(_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value))` his tx will revert
5. user is forced to set his msg.value to something higher in order to create a pool successfully
6. user sets msg.value to 110, 100 is taken as the baseFee and the remaining 10 is stuck in the contract

This happens each time a pool is to be created, while the amount lost is low, after so many pool creations, the lost ether will add up. And because there is no accounting of who overpaid the baseFee by how much, it is virtually impossible to return the overpaid fee back to the users.
## Impact
Users will overpay `baseFee` each time when creating pools, because there is no accounting of these overpaid fees, it is virtually impossible to return the lost funds to the users. Creating pools is a key function that will be called very frequently, each time a user will lose funds due to overpaying `baseFee`

## Recommendation
change >= to >

before
```solidity
(_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)
```
after
```solidity
(_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)
```
