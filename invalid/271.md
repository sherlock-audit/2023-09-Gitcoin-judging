# It is still possible for a strategy to be used as both a custom strategy and clonable strategy to create different pools.
Allo aims to implement the logic that a strategy is used as either a custom strategy to create a pool via ``createPoolWithCustomStrategy()`` or a clonable stategy to create a pool via ``createPool()``, but not both. 

Unfortunately, the goal has not been achieved -  it is possible  for a strategy to be used as both a custom strategy and a clonable strategy to create different pools. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider a strategy ``stra`` that is not yet a clonable strategy. 

1) Alice calls  ``createPoolWithCustomStrategy()``  using ``stra`` as a custom strategy to create pool1.

[https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L144-L161](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L144-L161)

2) The Allo owner calls ``addToCloneableStrategies()`` to add ``stra`` as a clonable strategy.

[https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L241-L246](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L241-L246)

3) Bob calls ``createPool()`` and uses ``stra`` as a clonable strategy to create pool2. 

[https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L174-L197](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L174-L197)

As a result, the same strategy ``sta`` is used as both a custom strategy and a clonable strategy to create pool1 and pool2. A violation of the design logic. 


## Impact
A violation of the design logic. It is possible  for a strategy to be used as both a custom strategy and a clonable strategy to create different pools.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Keep track of custom strategies as well so that a custom strategy cannot be added as a clonable strategy.  That is, a strategy is either custom or clonable, but not both.

In addition, one cannot remove a strategy if it has been used to create a pool to ensure it will not be changed from one categoy to another.
