# Potential Unauthorized Token Transfers Due to Arbitrary 'From' Address in '_transferAmountFrom' Function
## Summary
The function _transferAmountFrom in the Transfer contract uses transferFrom function from SafeTransferLib library with an arbitrary from address. This could potentially lead to unauthorized token transfers if not properly validated.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function _transferAmountFrom allows for the transfer of tokens from an arbitrary address specified in the TransferData struct. This could potentially allow an attacker to transfer tokens from any address if the function is not properly secured.

## Impact
If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized token transfers, potentially resulting in loss of funds for unsuspecting users.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _transferAmountFrom(address _token, TransferData memory _transferData) internal returns (bool) {
    uint256 amount = _transferData.amount;
    if (_token == NATIVE) {
        // Native Token
        if (msg.value < amount) revert AMOUNT_MISMATCH();
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_transferData.to, amount);
    } else {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(_token, _transferData.from, _transferData.to, amount);
    }
    return true;
}

Recommendation
Ensure that the from address in the TransferData struct is validated and authorized to prevent unauthorized token transfers. Consider implementing access controls or permissions to restrict who can call this function.
