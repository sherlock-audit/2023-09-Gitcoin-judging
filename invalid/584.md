# Protocol status check would failed when l2 sequencer goes down

Protocol status check will failed when l2 sequencer goes down.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, some functions of this protocol depend on L2 sequencer to check some status, such as allocation is alive or not, or pool is alive or not. However, it's vulnerable when l2 sequencer go down will cause that `block.timestamp` is unusable. Under such conditions, the protocol status check will failed.

L2 chains like arbitrum and optimism upgrade their sequencer occasional, such as the recent [optimism bedrock upgrade](https://cryptopotato.com/optimism-bedrock-upgrade-release-date-revealed/) cause the sequencer can't be able to process transactions for several hours. Or l2 sequencer bug could also cause transactions in stuck, such as [arbitrum sequencer bug](https://beincrypto.com/arbitrum-sequencer-bug-causes-temporary-transaction-pause/). So it's necessary to implement an mechanism to handle this issue in some abnormal conditions.


## Impact

Oracle price check will be failed when l2 sequencer goes down.

## Tool used

vscode, Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use ChainLink [sequencer up feed](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds), consider integrate the up time feed and give contract extra time when l2 sequencer goes down.
