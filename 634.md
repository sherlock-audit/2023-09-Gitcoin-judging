# Fee-On-Transfer tokens are not supported by Allo contract
## Summary

- [Sherlock documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin-Proxy1967#q-are-there-any-fee-on-transfer-tokens-interacting-with-the-smart-contracts) on the project says that when funding a pool on Allo.sol the Fee-On-Transfer tokens are expected to interact with the contracts, however the code in the contract do not support them.
- Some tokens that take a transfer fee are `STA` and `PAXG`, while `USDT` and `USDC` have the possibility to take a transfer fee in the future, but do not currently.

## Vulnerability Detail

- `Allo._fundPool()` is used to fund a pool with tokens, but it does not support fee-on-transfer tokens, even though the documentation states that it does.
- When `_fundPool` calls `_transferAmountFrom` on [L#513](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L513) a small amount of fee will be transferred to pay the fee, and then the rest of the token will be transferred to the treasury.
- Same thing happens when `_transferAmountFrom` is called on [L#516](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L516) except the rest of the token is transferred to the strategy (less amount than expected).

## Impact

- First `_transferAmountFrom` on [L#513](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L513) will cause the protocol to get less fee than required
- Second `_transferAmountFrom` on [L#516](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L516) will cause the pool to get less amount funded than wanted
- Lastly the `increasePoolAmount` on [L#517](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L517) will incorrectly increase the pool amount

## Code Snippet

- [Allo._fundPool()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L502-L520)

```solidity
    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

L513       _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

L516    _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
L517    _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Compare the balance before and after the `_transferAmountFrom` call.
