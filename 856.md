# Amount of Funds in pool inconsistent with expected amount
## Summary

This is just as a result of not accounting for fee on transfer tokens

The fees accounted for and the funds actually sent to the pool are different, luckily in this scenario it is not fatal since the custom function have a way to retrieve all funds, but in the case of custom strategy’s which profile owners will deploy we can’t always make that assumption, that’s why accurate state information on how much the pool currently holds will contribute to secure funds distribution.

The amount of money currently in the strategy pool and the pool amount are different, the effect of this could actually come up in different way, some of those ways are

## Impact

If a strategy wanted were to use a system where they have to transfer and distribute all their tokens all at once the, transaction will always revert because the pool does not have the pool amount in which the distribute function will be calling 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```
Before funding the pool, the fee amount for the protocol is removed and sent to the treasury of the protocol, but when the fee is transfrred to the strategy, which is the amountAfterFee.

```solidity
function increasePoolAmount(uint256 _amount) external override onlyAllo {
        _beforeIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
        poolAmount += _amount;
        _afterIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
    }
```

You can see that the amount being passed to the poolAmount is the amount that has being subtracted from the fee and the amount might be different from what the pool actually holdss

```solidity
function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (PayoutSummary memory)
    {
        Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];

        // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
        uint256 amount;
        if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
            amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
        }
        return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
    }
```
in the three custom strategy, i used Qv Startegy as an example here, the pool amount is used as way to subtract the amount to be transffered to the recipients, which might be totally different from the actual balance which the pool actually holds, which may in some situations lead to a revert of transaction if the total fee wants to be moved out.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Using state that does not correctly represent the state of things in the protocol should be avoided, fee on transfer tokens being used in this protocol, the amount of tokens actually in the pool should be gotten from the pool itself after the token transfer has been successfully completed.
