# Fee-on-transfer token will block payment for last recipient
## Summary
Allo.sol not handling the fee-on-transfer token while transferring tokens to Strategy. Resulting in revert the transfer of last recipient due to transfer of less tokens than original amount in `QVbaseStrategy`.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `_fundPool` method in Allo.sol  
```solidity
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

```
In case of fee-on-transfer token the `_transferAmountFrom` will transfer amount less than `amountAfterFee` to `_strategy`  and update the PoolAmount by original `amountAfterFee`.

In `_getPayout` in QVBaseStrategy.sol
```solidity
if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
            amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
        }
```
`amount` is calculated based on `poolAmount` , in case of last recipient the amount is not equal to the amount in pool , it will result in the transfer being reverted.

## Impact
Payment cannot be processed for last recipient in QVStrategy
