# Native tokens mistakenly sent to some Strategies will be stuck
## Summary
Native tokens mistakenly sent with _allocate()_ to Strategies that don't use Native token will be stuck
## Vulnerability Detail
When using _allocate()_ from Allo.sol we can use a _msg.value_. This value will be sent to the strategy of the corresponding pool, without checking if the strategy uses the native token. If a user mistakenly sends some native tokens, they will be stuck, since the _withdraw()_ functions use the _token_ of the pool. 
## Impact
Funds will be lost if users or pool managers send native tokens when allocating to a strategy that is not using native tokens.
## Code Snippet
Allo's allocate function that gets the _msg.value_ and sends it to the strategies:

One example of withdraw functions, which do not accept the token to be withdrawn as a parameter:

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check that _msg.value == 0_ when allocating inside the strategy if funds are not supposed to be received.
