# Users excess ETH sent to the pool will constantly be added to the Allo contract and get stuck

Any time a user creates or funds an existing pool, the excess ETH will be added to the Allo contract. This CANNOT be mitigated by calling [`recoverFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L283) because that function takes all of ETH in the contract and sends it to the `_recipient`. While the users could create or fund multiple pools before anyone can call `recoverFunds` for one user.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's look at the creation of a pool.

<details>
<summary>Theoretical explanation</summary>
<br>

- We call [`_createPool`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L415) from either external functions `createPool` or `createPoolWithCustomStrategy`, with amount to fund pool `_amount = 5 ether`.
- If `baseFee > 0` we MUST pay a base fee with ETH, let's say `baseFee = 1 ether`.
  - due to this [if statement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L473) we must send more ETH than we need to pay for `baseFee` and `_amount` we want to fund the pool with. So we send 1 more ether `msg.value = 7 ether`.
  - We pay the `baseFee` of 1 ether to the `treasury` via `_transferAmount`. Now `msg.value = 6 ether`.
- We pass the next `if (_amount > 0)` since we want to fund the pool with `_amount = 5 ether`, and it calls [`_fundPool`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L502).
- In `_fundPool` we can pay a `percentFee` if `percentFee > 0`, but we don't have to if it's 0 (in coded POC we pay `percentFee`).
  - Let's assume `percentFee = 0`. The function then calls `_transferAmountFrom` to send `_amountAfterFee` (which in this case is `_amount = 5 ether`) to `_strategy`.
- We are left with `msg.value = 1 ether` that gets stuck in the `Allo` contract

- To test add in `Allo.t.sol` and use command `forge t --mt testExcessEth -vv`

```solidity
function testExcessEth() public {
    uint256 baseFee = 1 ether;

    allo().updateBaseFee(baseFee);

    vm.deal(address(pool_admin()), 7 ether);
    // admin ether balance before = 7 ether
    assertEq(address(pool_admin()).balance, 7 ether); // pass

    // create a pool and fund it with 5 ether, while sending 7 ether to pay for fees
    vm.prank(pool_admin());
    allo().createPoolWithCustomStrategy{value: 7 ether}(
        poolProfile_id(), strategy, "0x", NATIVE, 5 ether, metadata, pool_managers()
    );

    // total in treasury = 1 ether from baseFee + 0.05 ether from percentFee(1% = 1e16) = 1.05 ether
    assertEq(allo_treasury().balance, 1.05 ether); // pass

    // in strategy = 5 ether - percentFee(0.05 ether) = 4.95 ether
    assertEq(strategy.balance, 4.95 ether); // pass

    // admin ether balance after should be 1 ether but its 0
    assertEq(address(pool_admin()).balance, 0); // pass

    // Allo should have 0 ether, but has 1 ether from the pool admin
    assertEq(address(allo()).balance, 1 ether); // pass
}
```

## Impact

Users ether will be stuck and unrecoverable.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Implement a way to refund users excess ETH sent to the pool and test it thoroughly.
