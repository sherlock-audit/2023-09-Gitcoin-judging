# Minimum Review Threshold Fails to Function Properly
## Summary

Users can alter the recipient status with fewer reviews than the stipulated minimum threshold, undermining the security design of the strategy.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the QVBaseStrategy contract, pool managers are responsible for reviewing applications to change a recipient's status. The status changes if the number of reviews aligns with or exceeds the minimum threshold specified by `reviewThreshold`.

                reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus]++;

                if (reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus] >= reviewThreshold) { 
                        Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
                        recipient.recipientStatus = recipientStatus;

For instance, if the current status of a recipient is 'Pending' and the `reviewThreshold` is set at `2`, the status will shift to 'Accepted' if two or more reviews endorse this status.

The crux of the issue lies in the subsequent not resetting of the `reviewsByStatus` mapping. Specifically, if a recipient requests a detail change, his status will change from `Accepted` to `Pending`. However, the `reviewsByStatus` mapping of `Accepted` status is not appropriately reset to zero but stay at two. This allows a status change from `Pending` to `Accept` to be approved with just `one` new review instead of the required `two`.

                if (currentStatus == Status.Accepted) {
                        // recipient updating accepted application
                        recipient.recipientStatus = Status.Pending;

## Impact

Due to this loophole, recipients can sidestep the intended security measures, requiring only one 'Approved' review to switch their status back to 'Accepted', rather than the intended minimum of two. It break the security design of the strategy.

## Recommendation

Reset the `reviewsByStatus` mapping after the status of the recipient is changed.
