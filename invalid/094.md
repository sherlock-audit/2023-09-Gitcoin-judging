# First pool depositor can be front-run
The `fundPool` function in the provided smart contract is susceptible to a front-running attack. This issue arises due to the lack of validation for checking whether a pool is already fully funded before allowing users to contribute tokens to it.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `fundPool` function is designed to allow users to contribute tokens to a specific pool. However, it lacks proper validation to prevent front-running attacks. Below is the vulnerable code snippet:
```solidity
function fundPool(uint256 _poolId, uint256 _amount) external payable nonReentrant {
    // No check for whether the pool is already fully funded
    // No check for excessive contributions
    // Call to the internal _fundPool function
    _fundPool(_amount, _poolId, pools[_poolId].strategy);
}
```
The vulnerability arises from the following aspects:
1. Lack of Validation: The function does not verify whether the pool is already fully funded before accepting user contributions. This allows malicious actors to front-run legitimate users and fund the pool before they do.
2. No Check for Excessive Contributions: The code does not prevent users from contributing more tokens than are needed to fully fund the pool. This oversight can result in users' funds being locked in the contract without contributing to the pool.
## Impact
The primary impact of this vulnerability is that the first pool depositor can be front-run by attackers who can quickly fund the pool, potentially causing a loss of funds for the legitimate user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
function fundPool(uint256 _poolId, uint256 _amount) external payable nonReentrant {
    // Check if the pool is already fully funded
    Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
    uint256 remainingFundsNeeded = pool.strategy.remainingFundsNeeded(_poolId);

    if (_amount == 0) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
    
    // Ensure that the user's contribution does not exceed the remaining funds needed
    if (_amount > remainingFundsNeeded) {
        revert EXCESSIVE_FUNDS();
    }

    // Call the internal fundPool() function
    _fundPool(_amount, _poolId, pool.strategy);
}
```
In this modified code, we added checks to ensure that the pool is not already fully funded and that the user's contribution does not exceed the remaining funds needed. This mitigates the front-running risk by preventing excessive contributions and ensuring fair access to pool funding. Additionally, you should define the `EXCESSIVE_FUNDS` error in your contract and provide appropriate error messages for clarity.
