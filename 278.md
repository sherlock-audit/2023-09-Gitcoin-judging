# If the owner changes the merkle root mid way, the old participants will get less rewards
## Summary
If the owner of [DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol) increases the rewards by changing the merkle root midway, the users before the change will receive fewer rewards than the users after the change.

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue arises due to the way users are verified for reward distribution. Specifically, users are checked using a simple true/false check. Therefore, a change in the merkle root will impact only those participants to whom rewards have not yet been distributed.

| *Prerequisites* | *Values*  |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Contract funds  | 20 000 DAI |
| Users           | 20        |
| DAI per user    | 1000      |

1. The owner sees the funds and [sets the merkle root](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L420-L436) to distribute 1000 DAI per user.
2. Since the users are 20, the owner splits the distribution call to 2, 10 users each call.
3. After sending the first call, a participant / investor [funds the contract](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L339-L345) with 2000 DAI -> 100 for every user
4.  Owner sees this funds and:
- If he knows his contract well he will set the merkle root to 1200 DAI per user (2000 / 10 = 200), since he knows it's impossible to distribute to already distributed users.
- If he doesn't know the contract that well he is gonna set the merkle root to 1100 DAI per user (2000 / 20 = 100), distribute to the other 10 users the 1100 DAI and try to distribute the other 1000 DAI to the first 10 users. However the call [would fail](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L783) ( [_validateDistribution](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L722-L724) ) and he would need to rescue the DAI from the contract.

From this example we can see that, it doesn't matter if the merkle root is changed,  as [this check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L722-L724) is too simple and will not allow to distribute the leftover funds (100 DAI) to the users who received the smaller portion (1000 DAI instead of 1100 DAI).

## Impact
User loss of rewards.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _validateDistribution() internal view returns (bool) {
        // If the '_index' has been distributed this will return 'false'
        if (_hasBeenDistributed(_index)) {
            return false;
        }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
You can make the check with amount instead of true false. For it i would recommend a mapping to be made to keep track of the distributed amounts.
