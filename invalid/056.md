# RFPSimpleStrategy owner can change recipient at any time
RFPSimpleStrategy owner can change recipient at any time
## Vulnerability Detail
`_allocate` function can be called [only when pool is active](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L391). It will [set recipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L395) and will [make pool inactive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L406).

So recipient will start work and submit milestones. But owner can [change pool to active](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219-L222) at any time and then call `_allocate` again with new recipient. In such way he can get job done for free. 
## Impact
Owner can change recipient at any time.

## Recommendation
There should not be ablity to change recipient. Or at least there should be evidence that he doesn't provide milestone or his milestone is rejected.
