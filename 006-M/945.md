# RFPSimpleStrategy: fail in distributing the upcoming milestone
 
## Summary

`RFPSimpleStrategy._distribute` can revert if `upcomingMilestone > 0` due to incorrect check at the line L#432.


## Vulnerability Detail

`RFPSimpleStrategy._distribute` function distributes the upcoming milestone to acceptedRecipientId. There is a check to make sure the contract has enough funds.
```solidity
431        // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
432        if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();


435        uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;


438        poolAmount -= amount;
```
The `recipient.proposalBid` is the total amount which should be distributed. So due to this check the `poolAmount` should not be less than `recipient.proposalBid` at any milestone.
But the `poolAmount` is decreased at each milestone and should be refilled or the `_distribute` will revert.


## Impact

`RFPSimpleStrategy._distribute` reverts for `upcomingMilestone > 0`. The contract functionality will be broken.

## Recommendation

Consider using `(recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18 > poolAmount` instead of `recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount` at the line L#432.
