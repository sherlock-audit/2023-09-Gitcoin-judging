# Unrestricted setPoolActive Function
## Summary

The `setPoolActive` function is missing essential access controls, permitting unrestricted public access for toggling the pool's active status.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function's Natspec comments indicate that only the `pool manager` should be able to call `setPoolActive`. However, this requirement isn't codified, enabling anyone to toggle the pool between active and inactive states.

                function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
                        _setPoolActive(_flag);
                        emit PoolActive(_flag);
                }

## Impact

This security gap could be exploited to disrupt critical contract operations. Specifically, unauthenticated users could block the `withdrawal` and `distribution` processes, as both operations are permissible only when the `onlyInactivePool` condition is met. Similarly, `allocation` processes could be halted because they are only viable when the `onlyActivePool` condition is fulfilled.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add an `onlyPoolManager` modifier to the setPoolActive function, thereby ensuring that only the pool manager can invoke it.
