# Missing check if the status given when calling `QVBaseStrategy.reviewRecipient` is `accepted` or `rejected`
Because of a missing check what status is given when calling `QVBaseStrategy.reviewRecipient` a recipient can be prevented to be approved in the future

## Vulnerability Detail

In ` QVBaseStrategy` a pool manager must review each recipient and decide if he is rejected or accepted by setting his status accordingly. The problem is that it is not checked if the status provided by the poolManager is `accepted` or `rejected` before setting the recipient status to it. This can result in the case where a pool manager gives the status `none` or `appealed` for the recipient and setting his status accordingly. This would result in the recipient not been able to be accepted any more, even if a pool manager would review him again, because the function `reviewRecipients` reverts if the recipient has the status `none` or `appealed`.  

```solidity
// if the status is none or appealed then revert
            if (recipientStatus == Status.None || recipientStatus == Status.Appealed) {
                revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
            }
```


## Impact
Recipients will be blocked from been accepted

## Recommendation

Before setting the status of a recipient make sure to check if the given status is `accepted` or `rejected`. If it is not, revert.
