# removeMembers in Registry might run out of gas
## Summary
RemoveMembers in Registry.sol might run out of gas before revoking roles of all selected members.

## Vulnerability Detail
Registry.sol , at line 306:
```solidity
    function removeMembers(bytes32 _profileId, address[] memory _members) external onlyProfileOwner(_profileId) {
        uint256 memberLength = _members.length;

        // Loop through the members and remove them from the profile by revoking the role
        for (uint256 i; i < memberLength;) {
            // Revoke the role from the member and emit the event for each member
            _revokeRole(_profileId, _members[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```
Might run out of gas in the for loop.
## Impact
Wrong usage might lead to not properly removing members.
