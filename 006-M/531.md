# Invalid poolAmount check will result in a failed distribution
RFPSimpleStrategy fund distribution fails when `proposalBid` is higher than `poolAmount` allocated for remaining milestones.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
`_distribute` in `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` has an incorrect check for `poolAmount` 
```solidity
if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
// Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;
```

`proposalBid` is the total amount the agent gets for all milestones whereas `poolAmount` is remaining funds in the pool. It decreases with every completed milestone and should be compared with `amount` instead.
 
## Impact
The agent will not be able to receive funds and complete a milestone

## Recommendation
Change to
```diff
- if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
- // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
- uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;
+ // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
+ uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;
+ if (amount > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
```
