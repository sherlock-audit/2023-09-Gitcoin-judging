# QVBaseStrategy does not update poolAmount value after distributing tokens
## Summary
QVBaseStrategy does not update poolAmount value after distributing tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
Depositing/funding the pool increases the poolAmount variable and the token balance of the contract
but distributing tokens transfers the tokens to recipients and decreases the amount of tokens in the strategy/pool 
yet the poolAmount variable is not adjusted:

```solidity
    function _distribute(address[] memory _recipientIds, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
        onlyAfterAllocation
    {
        uint256 payoutLength = _recipientIds.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < payoutLength;) {
            address recipientId = _recipientIds[i];
            Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];

            PayoutSummary memory payout = _getPayout(recipientId, "");
            uint256 amount = payout.amount;

            if (paidOut[recipientId] || !_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId) || amount == 0) {
                revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
            }

            IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
            _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount); 

            paidOut[recipientId] = true;

            emit Distributed(recipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender); // @audit poolAmount should be updated after distribute
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```
## Impact
QVBaseStrategy uses poolAmount to calculate how much it will distribute in _getPayout():
```solidity
    function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (PayoutSummary memory)
    {
        Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];

        // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
        uint256 amount;
        if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
            amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
        }
        return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
    }
```
Not adjusting the poolAmount after distributing will lead to incorrect calculation of following distributions
