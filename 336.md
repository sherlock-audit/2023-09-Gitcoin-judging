# onlyProfileOwner modifier can be bypassed by calling removeMembers() directly.
## Summary
The onlyProfileOwner modifier in removeMembers() only checks msg.sender at the time of the function call. This means a malicious contract can bypass it by calling removeMembers() directly.
## Vulnerability Detail
The onlyProfileOwner modifier checks if the msg.sender is the owner of the profile: [Link1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L67-L69) , [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L326-L328)
However, this only checks the msg.sender at the time of the function call. A malicious contract could call the removeMembers() function directly, bypassing the onlyProfileOwner modifier. 

So in summary:
• Modifiers only check msg.sender at call time
• Malicious contract can bypass by calling directly
• Need to re-check access control within function as well
• Mitigate by adding explicit ownership check inside function


## Impact
- Attacker can remove members from any profile without being the owner
- Bypasses access control

Manual Review

## Recommendation
access control checks should also be done within the removeMembers() function
