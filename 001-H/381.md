``RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive()`` lacks an access control, therefore, anybody can call it and changes the status of the pool to active/inactive. 

Impact: Many functions depend on the status of the pool, if the status of the pool is changed, the logic of the contracts will be totally wrong.  It might lead to loss of funds since a pool manager will be able to withdraw even when the pool is active by changing it to inactive first.


It will also allow a second pool manager to replace an existing ``acceptedRecipientId`` by calling ``RFPSimpleStrategy._allocate()`` although the original design is that ``acceptedRecipientId`` can only be set once. 


## Vulnerability Detail

``RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive()``  allows one to change the status of the pool:

[https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219-L222](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219-L222)

However, it lacks an access control, so anybody can call it and changes its status to active/inactive. 

Many functions depend on the status of the pool: 

1) _registerRecipient():

[https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L314-L380](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L314-L380)

2) _allocate()

[https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L386-L412](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L386-L412)

3) _distribute():

[https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L417-L450](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L417-L450)

4) withdraw():

[https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L295-L301](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L295-L301)

As a result, a malicious user can change the status of the pool, and enables the execution of some functions in a state that is not supposed to be executed. For example, a pool manager can only withdraw funds when the pool is inactive - but now even when the pool is active, a bad manager can changes the pool to inactive, withdraw the funds, and then change it back to active. Similarly, one can changes an inactive pool to an active one, and then call ``allocate()`` which is supposed to be execute when the pool is active. 


## Impact
Anybody can change the status of the pool, an important state of the contract. As a result, the inner state of the contract is confused, that leads to wrong execution logic of functions. 

In addition, It might lead to loss of funds since a pool manager will be able to withdraw even when the pool is active by changing it to inactive first. It will also allow a second pool manager to replace an existing ``acceptedRecipientId`` by calling ``RFPSimpleStrategy._allocate()`` although the original design is that ``acceptedRecipientId`` can only be set once.
