# Missing access control for `setPoolActive` in `RFPSimpleStrategy` (and `RFPCommitteeStrategy`)
Most of the functions in `RFPSimpleStrategy` and `RFPCommitteeStrategy` (inherited from `RFPSimpleStrategy`) are protected by the `poolActive` flag, which is used to determine whether the pool is currently active or not. However, the setter function (`setPoolActive`) does not verify that msg.sender is the pool manager, allowing anyone to call this function and potentially bypass the checks for pool activity in various functions.

Some scenarios that may affect the protocol include:
* It can be used to participate in a pool even when the pool is inactive (`registerRecipient`).
* It can be exploited by a malicious actor to front-run legitimate users when they attempt to participate in a pool (`registerRecipient`) so that no one can join the pool.
* It can be used to front-run the pool manager, thus avoiding calls to the `distribute` and `withdraw` functions..

## Vulnerability Detail
As mentioned in the function comments and documentations, this function should only be accessible to the pool manager.
```solidity
    /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```

Other functions affected by this issue include: `_registerRecipient`, `_allocate`, `_distribute`, `withdraw`. 

## Impact
* It can be used to participate in a pool even when the pool is inactive (`registerRecipient`).
* It can be exploited by a malicious actor to front-run legitimate users when they attempt to participate in a pool (`registerRecipient`) so that no one can join the pool.
* It can be used to front-run the pool manager, thus avoiding calls to the `distribute` and `withdraw` functions..

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Adding `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` to `setPoolActive` function.

```solidity
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
