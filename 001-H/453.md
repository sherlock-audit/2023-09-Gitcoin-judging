# anyone can call setPoolActive() in RFPSimpleStrategy to make it active/inactive
anyone can call setPoolActive() in RFPSimpleStrategy to set it's active/inactive state. there is no access control on the function. 

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the function's natspec comments, only the pool manager should be able to call the setPoolActive function to close the pool  but anyone can call setPoolActive() to set it active/inactive state. there is no access control on the function.

## Impact
important contract function setPoolActive() is open to anyone to call. Anyone can set the state and gain access to other core functions when pool is set to inactive. Here the functionality of the protocol can be impaired and it's avaliabilty can be affected too as it can be accessed when it ought not to be.
