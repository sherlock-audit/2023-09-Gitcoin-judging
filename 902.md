# [M-09] `QVSimpleStrategy` contract: removing pool allocators will not remove their votes
## Summary

`QVSimpleStrategy` contract: removing pool allocators will not remove their votes.

## Vulnerability Detail

- In `QVSimpleStrategy` strategy contract: funds accepted recipients are receiving funds based on the votes they got from the accepted allocators (pool managers).

- Then when the funds are distributed; each accepted recipient will receive payment proportional to the total number of votes they received:

  [QVBaseStrategy::\_getPayout function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L559-L574)

  ```solidity
      function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
          internal
          view
          virtual
          override
          returns (PayoutSummary memory)
      {
          Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];

          // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
          uint256 amount;
          if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
              amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
          }
          return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
      }
  ```

- But allocators can be removed by the pool admin via `Allo::removePoolManager`; and when doing so, the votes that were given by the removed allocator will still be counted.

## Impact

If a recipient got votes from removed allocators; they will be getting more funds upon distribution due to the counting of the invalid votes of the removed allocators.

## Code Snippet

        Recipient storage _recipient,
        address _recipientId,
        uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate,
        address _sender
    ) internal onlyActiveAllocation {
        // check the `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` is > 0
        if (_voiceCreditsToAllocate == 0) revert INVALID();

        // get the previous values
        uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
        uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId];

        // get the total credits and calculate the vote result
        uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
        uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);

        // update the values
        voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
        totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
        _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;

        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
        _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;

        // emit the event with the vote results
        emit Allocated(_recipientId, voteResult, _sender);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a mechanism to remove/invalidate removed allocator votes so that it would't be counted when calculating the recipient distributed payment.
