# `setPoolActive`   don't  have access  control
## Summary
`setPoolActive`   don't  have access  control.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
   function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
In   `RFPSimpleStrategy` ,  pool  active or  not is very important,  it  controls  the access of `allocate` and `distribute` in this  strategy.
```solidity
   function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
@>        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {
    
    
       function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        nonReentrant
  @>      onlyActivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {


 ```
  If don't have  proper access control of   set pool active or  not, the whole strategy would be  destroyed.


## Impact
 The whole strategy would be destroyed and not work properly
