# Allo.registerRecipient doesn't transfer provided funds
## Summary
Allo.registerRecipient doesn't transfer provided funds. In case if user provided funds along the call, then they will sit in the Allo contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
`Allo.registerRecipient` function [is payable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L301C78-L301C86). It then calls `strategy.registerRecipient` function, which is [payable too](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L167). However, `Allo.registerRecipient` [doesn't provide funds to the strategy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L303) with the call.
## Impact
In case if user provided funds along the call, then they will sit in the Allo contract.
