# Fee-on-transfer not supported in fundPool
## Summary
According to the contest page (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L28), fee-on-transfer can be used when funding a pool.
However, the current implementation does not support fee-on-transfer and therefore does not work as intended.

## Vulnerability Detail
When Allo.sol's fundPool is performed, Strategy's `increasePoolAmount` is called. Because _amount represents the quantity to be transferred, not the actual quantity transferred, poolAmount will store a value greater than the actual tokens transferred.

```solidity
function increasePoolAmount(uint256 _amount) external override onlyAllo {
        _beforeIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
        poolAmount += _amount;
        _afterIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
    }
```

The `poolAmount` stored in this way is used when distributing from the `Strategy`, and since it is set to a value larger than the actual token holdings, calculations using it will return incorrect values.

For example, `QVBaseStrategy._getPayout` below.

```solidity
function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (PayoutSummary memory)
    {
        Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];

        // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
        uint256 amount;
        if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
            amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
        }
        return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
    }
```
The payout is determined by the percentage of votes received in the `poolAmount`, but because the payout is set to be larger than it should be, people who receive late payouts may not be rewarded.

## Impact
If your `fundPool` doesn't properly support fee-on-transfer, some users may not get rewarded.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend passing the actual amount transferred in the `increasePoolAmount` argument, or calling transfer inside the `Strategy` to add the increased balance to the `poolAmount`.
