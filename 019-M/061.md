# In case if QVSimpleStrategy pool will be funded after some user's already received payment, then distribution will be incorrect
In case if QVSimpleStrategy pool will be funded after some user's already received payment, then distribution will be incorrect
## Vulnerability Detail
`QVSimpleStrategy.distribute` can be called several times in order to pay funds to recipients. User receives amount that depends on votes count that he received. So he will [get percentage of `poolAmount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L571).

`poolAmount` is changed when owner funds pool. In case if pool will be funded between several `distribute` calls, that means not all funds will be distributed and some of them will stuck in the pool
## Impact
Distribution will be incorrect
