# Single reviewer can review a recipient past the review threshold atomically in QVBaseStrategy
## Summary

Logic used to validate that a recipient has been sufficiently reviewed can be avoided, removing the need for the logic entirely.

Note: Although pool managers are trusted, since the logic is intended to enforce trust and doesn't effectively do so, it is redundant at best.

## Vulnerability Detail

`QVBaseStrategy.reviewRecipients` validates that a recipient has been reviewed to have a same status multiple times before actually applying that status to the recipient. The problem with this logic is that there's no enforcement that this status has been reviewed by different pool managers, in fact the same pool manager can loop over the same recipientId and status enough to exceed the reviewThreshold in one simple call to `reviewRecipients`. As a result, there's no benefit in using this logic, and since pool managers are trusted it would make more sense to remove multiple review logic altogether to make the process much more efficient as this decision can be made off-chain. Alternatively, if we want this voting logic to be valid, we can enforce that reviews are coming from multiple pool managers.

## Impact

Review threshold logic is easily manipulable and redundant at best.

```solidity
reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus]++;

if (reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus] >= reviewThreshold) {
    Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
    recipient.recipientStatus = recipientStatus;

    emit RecipientStatusUpdated(recipientId, recipientStatus, address(0));
}
```

## Recommendation

Validate that reviews are coming from multiple pool managers by including a mapping to track whether a given pool manager has reviewed a given recipient.
