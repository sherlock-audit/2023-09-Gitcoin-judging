# Allo contract's balance can be drained because of incorrect checks

As you can see by the comments, they explain that if the token is NATIVE then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value. And if the token is not native then baseFee should be >= than msg.value. All that is stated by the comments, but what the code actually does is that if these conditions are met, it will revert


## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
// To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
// If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
// If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
```
Now look at the actual check:

```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
           revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
}
```


## Impact

Since the checks above are used in order to not take any additional funds from the Allo balance, they are not working correctly which an attacker can use as his advantage to drain funds from the protocol.

Also user which follow the comments and actually meet the correct criteria in order to correctly pay fees to the pool, their tx will always revert.
