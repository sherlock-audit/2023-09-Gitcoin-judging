# Protocol won't work with tokens that can prevent transfers e.g pausable, blacklist, blocklist
## Summary
Protocol won't work with tokens that can prevent transfers e.g pausable, blacklist, blocklist

## Vulnerability Detail
There are various tokens  and token standards that can result in transfers being stopped, blocked, blacklisted, paused or disallowed. This entails protocols may function well with these tokens up until a time when any of above measures activated leading to inability to perform transfers into and out of the protocol

## Impact
Tokens such as ERC20Pausable, Pausable Tokens like WBTC,  ERC1400, USDT, Polymath like tokens; it implies the all instances mentioned in the links provided will not function for transfers. Whats worse is tokens with blacklisting capabilities may block contract addresses of protocol which renders them incapable to send and receive these tokens to function fully.

etc and such other transfer of tokens related parts 

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommended to whitelist tokens and not allow such tokens
