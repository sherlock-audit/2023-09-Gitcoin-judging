# Check for Non-Zero Length and Matching Lengths in batchRegisterRecipient Function
The `batchRegisterRecipient` function should include checks to ensure that both the `_poolIds` and `_data` arrays have non-zero lengths and that their lengths match.

label: low

## Vulnerability Detail
he function does not include checks to verify that both `_poolIds` and `_data` have non-zero lengths and that their lengths match.
## Impact
The absence of these checks could lead to unexpected behavior or errors if the arrays have mismatched or zero lengths.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function batchRegisterRecipient(uint256[] memory _poolIds, bytes[] memory _data)
        external
        nonReentrant
        returns (address[] memory recipientIds)
    {
        uint256 poolIdLength = _poolIds.length;
        recipientIds = new address[](poolIdLength);

        if (poolIdLength != _data.length) revert MISMATCH();

        // Loop through the '_poolIds' & '_data' and call the 'strategy.registerRecipient()' function
        for (uint256 i; i < poolIdLength;) {
            recipientIds[i] = pools[_poolIds[i]].strategy.registerRecipient(_data[i], msg.sender);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }

        // Return the recipientIds that have been registered
        return recipientIds;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add checks to ensure that both the _poolIds and _data arrays have non-zero lengths and that their lengths match in the batchRegisterRecipient function. This will help prevent unexpected behavior or errors caused by mismatched or zero-length arrays.
