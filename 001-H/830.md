# Anyone can change the pool status of RFPSimpleStrategy
RFPSimpleStrategy's `setPoolActive` can be called by anyone, so you can close the pool arbitrarily.
## Vulnerability Detail

RFPSimpleStrategy's `setPoolActive` has no `onlyPoolManager`, so anyone can call it.

```solidity
function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external { 
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
## Impact
Malicious user can prevent `_registerRecipient` and `_allocate`, which are not available when `poolActive` is `false`, or prevent `_distribute`, which is only available when `poolActive` is `true`.
