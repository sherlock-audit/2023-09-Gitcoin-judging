# Contracts are vulnerable to rebasing accounting-related issues
## Summary

Contracts are vulnerable to rebasing accounting-related issues

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens may make arbitrary balance modifications outside of transfers (e.g. Ampleforth style rebasing tokens, Compound style airdrops of governance tokens, mintable/burnable tokens).

Some smart contract systems cache token balances (e.g. Balancer, Uniswap-V2), and arbitrary modifications to underlying balances can mean that the contract is operating with outdated information.

In the case of Ampleforth, some Balancer and Uniswap pools are special cased to ensure that the pool's cached balances are atomically updated as part of the rebase procedure ([details](https://www.ampltalk.org/app/forum/technology-development-17/topic/supported-dex-pools-61/)).

## Impact

## Code Snippet

```solidity

512:            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));

515:            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));

```
