# Incorrect Implementation of Upgradability Pattern
## Summary

By inheriting from non-upgradeable OpenZeppelin contracts, the subsequent versions of the contract can become corrupt.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Allo and Registry contracts employ an upgradability pattern but make the mistake of inheriting from non-upgradeable OpenZeppelin contracts.

        import "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L5

The contracts should inherit from `AccessControlUpgradeable` rather than `AccessControl`.

OpenZeppelin's non-upgradeable contracts are not designed to support future upgrades. Specifically, they lack the `__gap` variable that helps reserve storage slots for future versions to prevent storage layout conflicts during the inheritance chain.

        /**
        * @dev This empty reserved space is put in place to allow future versions to add new
        * variables without shifting down storage in the inheritance chain.
        * See https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps
        */
        uint256[50] private __gap;

## Impact

The contract storage can be corrupted if a new variable is added to the parent contract in future iterations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The contract should inherent from `AccessControlUpgradeable` instead of `AccessControl`.

```diff
- import "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";
+ import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol";
```
