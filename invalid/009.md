# zero feeAmount can be  transferred to treasury address.
Allo._createPool internal function is calling _fundPool internal function if amount of the token to be deposited in the pool is greater than zero
#L480_L481
```solidity
if (_amount > 0) {
            _fundPool(_amount, poolId, _strategy);
        }
```
_fundPool internal function is doing a transfer to `treasury` by calculating feeAmount as `feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();`  and to `startegy` by subtracting feeAmount by amount to transfer i.e. `amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;`

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem with the above calculation is that it is likely to cause a precision loss while calculating `feeAmount`
 `feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();`
any condition, where ` (_amount * percentFee)` is less than `getFeeDenominator()`  = 1e18 as in L599 
```solidity
function getFeeDenominator() public pure returns (uint256 FEE_DENOMINATOR) {
        return 1e18;
    }
``` 
The calculation take place as:
```solidity
feeAmount = (100 * 1e15) / 1e18 = 0.1 = round down to 0
```
therefore if  `_amount = 100` and `percentFee = 1e15 `, Every time it will round down to 0, and their are many more such permutations of ` (_amount * percentFee)` that becomes less than 1e18 and the resultant `feeAmount` will round down to 0.

## Impact
No transfer will happen to `treasury` due to the above reason.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);
```

Use openzeppelin safeMath library OR Make changes in calculation to get rid of precision loss.
