# The poolAmount is subtracted from before the transfer, which can  lead to issues if the transfer fails.
## Summary
The poolAmount subtraction happens before the transfer in the _distributeSingle() function. If the transfer fails after that, the accounting would be incorrect

## Impact
• Withdrawing more than the available pool balance later by undercounting transfers out
• Double distributing funds if attempted again after a failed transfer

If _transferAmount() were to revert/fail, the poolAmount would be incorrectly reduced even though no funds were transferred.
This could allow:
• Withdrawing more than the available pool balance later by undercounting transfers out
• Double distributing funds if attempted again after a failed transfer
