# Protocol charges more than baseFee.
## Summary
Users will have to always pay more than the ```baseFee``` when creating a new pool using the ```_createPool``` function in the **Allo.sol** contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the ```_createPool``` function in the Allo contract there is a check when baseFee > 0:
```solidity
if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
```
this means that if users send the require baseFee the transaction will still fail and to create a pool they must always pay more than the baseFee.

## Impact
users should always pay more than the base fee when creating a new pool otherwise the new pool cannot be created.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check that the msg.value is exactly equal to the baseFee when token is not native or check that ```baseFee + _amount == msg.value``` when token is native and revert if the conditions are not true.
or instead of this:
```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
```
use only ```>``` instead of ```>=``` and make sure to send back the excess eth to he sneder.
