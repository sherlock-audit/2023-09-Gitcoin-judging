# Duplicate Strategy Addresses Allowed in `addToCloneableStrategies`
The `addToCloneableStrategies` function in the `Allo` contract allows the same strategy address to be added to the `cloneableStrategies` mapping multiple times without any checks, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and unnecessary gas costs.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `addToCloneableStrategies` function in the `Allo` contract is intended to add strategy addresses to the `cloneableStrategies` mapping. However, it lacks a check to prevent the addition of the same strategy address multiple times. This means that if an address is added as a cloneable strategy more than once, it will be duplicated in the mapping, which could result in unintended consequences.

Here's the code snippet of the `addToCloneableStrategies` function:
```solidity
function addToCloneableStrategies(address _strategy) external onlyOwner {
    if (_strategy == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

    // Check if the strategy is already approved
    if (cloneableStrategies[_strategy]) {
        revert STRATEGY_ALREADY_APPROVED();
    }

    // Approve the strategy
    cloneableStrategies[_strategy] = true;
    emit StrategyApproved(_strategy);
}
```
## Impact
The impact of allowing duplicate strategy addresses to be added to the `cloneableStrategies` mapping without checks is primarily related to gas inefficiency and potential inconsistencies in removal. Gas inefficiency arises from unnecessary iterations over duplicate entries, leading to higher transaction costs. Additionally, when using the `removeFromCloneableStrategies` function, removing duplicates may lead to inconsistent behavior, such as removing one duplicate while leaving the other intact, causing confusion and unintended modifications.

## Recommendation
Implement a check in the `addToCloneableStrategies` function to ensure that the strategy address is not already present in the `cloneableStrategies` mapping before adding it.
