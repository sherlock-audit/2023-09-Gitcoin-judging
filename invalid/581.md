# Two-step ownership transfer process in Registry.sol can be bypassed
Two-step ownership transfer process in Registry.sol can be bypassed.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the owner accidentally calls "updateProfilePendingOwner()" with an incorrect address, a malicious user could call "acceptProfileOwnership()" to gain ownership of the profile and then carry out other malicious actions.
There are similar reports here.

## Impact
If the owner accidentally calls "updateProfilePendingOwner()" with an incorrect address, it may bypass the two-step ownership transfer process.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a inTransferOwnership state variable, which ensures that acceptProfileOwnership() cannot be called while updateProfilePendingOwner() is in execution, similar to a reentrancy guard:

    function updateProfilePendingOwner(bytes32 _profileId, address _pendingOwner)
        external
        onlyProfileOwner(_profileId)
    {
    inTransferOwnership = true;

    // Some code here...

    inTransferOwnership = false;
    }


    function acceptProfileOwnership(bytes32 _profileId) external {
     if (inTransferOwnership) revert CannotAcceptOwnershipDuringTransfer();

    // Some code here...
}
