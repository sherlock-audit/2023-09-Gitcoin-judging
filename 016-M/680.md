# `QVBaseStrategy.reviewRecipients()`'s voting mechanism lacks a record of the voting target content (the recipient state it targets), resulting in different starting states for votes after the recipient state changes.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation only records the number of votes in `reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus]`, that is
-   Only (recipientId, recipientStatus) is recorded
-   The `recipients[recipientId].metadata`, `recipients[recipientId].recipientAddress`, and `recipients[recipientId].useRegistryAnchor` at the time the pool manager creates the voting transaction are not recorded

This results in votes for different `recipients[recipientId].metadata`, `recipients[recipientId].recipientAddress`, and `recipients[recipientId].useRegistryAnchor` being mixed together.

Here are some examples:

1. Abnormal voting when `recipients[recipientId].recipientStatus == Status.Appealed`

When `recipients[alice].recipientStatus` changes from Status.Pending to Status.Rejected, `reviewsByStatus[alice][Status.Rejected]` has already accumulated a number of votes greater than or equal to `reviewThreshold`.

Alice called `registerRecipient()` to modify the information and change `recipients[alice].recipientStatus` from Status.Rejected to Status.Appealed, and starts a new round of `reviewRecipients` voting.

In this round of voting, the starting `reviewsByStatus[alice][Status.Accepted]` and `reviewsByStatus[alice][Status.Rejected]` (already at or above `reviewThreshold`) are significantly different, making it difficult to vote for `Status.Accepted` (regardless of the new information modified by Alice).

2. Deceiving the number of votes in `reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus]`

Bob called `registerRecipient()` to create `recipients[bob].metadata`, `recipients[bob].recipientAddress`, and `recipients[bob].useRegistryAnchor` with excellent conditions, wait until `reviewsByStatus[bob][Status.Accepted]` is close to `reviewThreshold`.

Bob called `registerRecipient()` to change `recipients[bob].metadata`, `recipients[bob].recipientAddress`, and `recipients[bob].useRegistryAnchor` to Bob's real conditions.

At this time, `reviewsByStatus[bob][Status.Accepted]` (already close to `reviewThreshold`) and `reviewsByStatus[bob][Status.Rejected]` are significantly different, making it difficult to vote for `Status.Rejected` (regardless of the new information modified by Bob).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider making the following changes:

- Add a version number nonce field to the recipient and automatically increment it each time `registerRecipient()` is called.
- Add the recipientNonce parameter to `reviewRecipients()`.
- Change `reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus]` to `reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientNonce][recipientStatus]`.
- Before modifying `recipients[recipientId].recipientStatus`, require that the current nonce of `recipients[recipientId]` is consistent with recipientNonce when `reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientNonce][recipientStatus] >= reviewThreshold`.
