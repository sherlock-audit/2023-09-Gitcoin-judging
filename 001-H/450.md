# `setPool` can be called by anyone
since there is no access control on `setPool` it enables loss of funds and dos attacks 
## Vulnerability Detail
since this code snippet below says it needs the permission of the pool Manager and it doesn't have that control. Anyone can call it.
```solidity
    /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag); // @audit-confirmed input validatoin
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```

## Impact
1. Dos attack by frontrunning and then backrunning the user/Pool manager actions
2. making the pool active to register more
3. front run distribute or all the PoolManager funds to cause reverts and not allow allocating and distributing,withdraw
4. The attacker can increase their proposalBid by turning the pool active then turning the pool inactive as `distribute` gets called
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) onlyInactivePool {
        // Decrement the pool amount
        poolAmount -= _amount;

        // Transfer the amount to the pool manager
        _transferAmount(allo.getPool(poolId).token, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```
here is an example of how an attacker can cause reverts and make the funds stuck in the contract or gain unfair advantages

## Recommendation
set PoolManager modifier/function access control as the comments say
