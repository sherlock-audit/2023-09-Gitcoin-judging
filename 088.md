# Permanent DoS of allocations and distributions of RFPSimpleStrategy contract
## Summary
For `RFPSimpleStrategy` a pool has to be in active state in order to allocate funds and in inactive state in order to distribute them. This is achieved in the code by setting the `poolActive` flag to true upon initialization and to false when the recipient is selected for the allocation. However, there exists an unprotected function that can set the `poolActive` flag to any value. Anyone can permanently dos allocation and distribution by frontrunning calls to `_allocate` and `_distribute`  functions and changing the value of `poolActive` flag so that calls to the former and latter would revert.
## Vulnerability Detail
See summary.
## Impact
Permanent DoS of the strategy, possibly locked funds.

## Recommendation
Add the `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` modifier to the `setPoolActive()` function.
