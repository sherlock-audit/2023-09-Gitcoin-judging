# since `_allocator.voiceCreidtsCastToReceipeints+=totalCredits` is wrong and will be infliated not like the spec
## Summary
since there is a wrong adding on to `voiceCreditsCastToRecipeints` the recipients can get substantially  more votes 
## Vulnerability Detail
so for example 
If Alice the allocator gives 5 credits to Bob 
then a day later Alice gives another 5 credits to Bob
bobs total credits=15 which it should not be.
so bob total `votes=3162277660 = sqrt(10e18)`
Then sam the allocator gives 1 credit to Bob
which should only be 11 credits but instead he gets  credits 16 which is `4000000000` votes 

This is because 
```solidity
        uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
        // get the total credits and calculate the vote result
        uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
        uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);
_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
```
one the  first call from Alice it will be correct and `voiceCreditsCastToRecipient=5`
The second call 
`creditsCastToReceipient=5`
`totalCredits=5+5`
so when we update `voiceCreditsCastToReceipint+=10` it going to `=15`
## Impact
1. The allocator can do this on purpose to get their favorite recipient more credits exponentially 
and then someone else allocates 1 credit giving the recipient way more votes or the allocator can just use 9 credits and then use 1 getting more votes
then when `_distribute` is called the recipient will get more funds since they got more votes 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    // check the `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` is > 0
        if (_voiceCreditsToAllocate == 0) revert INVALID();

        // get the previous values
        uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
        uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId];

        // get the total credits and calculate the vote result
        uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
        uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);

        // update the values
        voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
        totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
        _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;
// @audit we are += the totalCredits instead of = which causes the issue 
        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
        _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;

        // emit the event with the vote results
        emit Allocated(_recipientId, voteResult, _sender);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
instead of +=
it should be = 

```solidity
_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]= totalCredits;
```
