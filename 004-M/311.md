# QVBaseStrategy.sol#_qv_allocate()
`_qv_allocate` is used to allocate voice credits to a recipient.  The function takes all the previous `creditsCastToRecipient` and `votesCastToRecipient`, calculates the `totalCredits` and `voteResult` (basically the NEW TOTAL credits and votes for that recipient).

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem occurs in the following lines:

```javascript
       // update the values
        voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
        totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
        _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;

        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
        _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;
```
We can see that we subtract `votesCastToRecipient` (PREVIOUS votes) from `voteResult` (TOTAL votes), then we add `voteResult` (which is now just the NEW votes) to the allocator's `votesCastToRecipient`. The problem lies that we don't do the same for `totalCredits`. We do not subtract `creditsCastToRecipient` (previous) from `totalCredits` (total). Because we don't do this when we get to this line `_alocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[recipientId] += totalCredits` we basically take the old credits and add the total credits, which includes the old credits in them.

Let's look at a short example:
creditsCastToRecipient = 10 (previous)
_voiceCreditsToAllocate = 10 (new)

totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate  + _voiceCreditsToAllocate  (10+10 = 20)

_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits (10 + 20 = 30)

We forget to remove the `creditsCastToRecipient` from `totalCredits` and this issue occurs.

## Impact
Incorrect accounting of votes. Allocators will influence the votes exponentially more, even when they don't allocate that many credits.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the following line to get the correct accounting:
`totalCredits -= creditsCastToRecipient`
