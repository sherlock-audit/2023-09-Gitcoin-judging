# The recipient can obtain tokens that have already been marked as "Rejected for Payment" by the pool manager.
The recipient can obtain tokens that have already been marked as "Rejected for Payment" by the pool manager.

## Vulnerability Detail
The status of milestone can be changed to **Status.Rejected** by pool manager before this portion of tokens is distributed to the recipient. According to my understanding, when the milestone's status is set to **Status.Rejected**, the tokens associated with this milestone will not be distributed to the recipient.

However, the _distribute() function does not check the milestone's status and proceeds to distribute the tokens associated with the milestone to the recipient.

## Recommendation
Check the milestone's status before distributing tokens to the recipient. If the status is "Reject," then do not distribute these tokens to the recipient.
