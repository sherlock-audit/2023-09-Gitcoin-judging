# In QVStrategy, regular member can exclude some recipient candidates by resetting the `Accepted` status back to `Pending`
## Summary
In `QVStrategy` during registration time, any member can register a potential recipient, and those recipients are later subject to voting. Such recipient will receive status `Pending`. To gain status `Accepted`, required for allocation/payout, a manager review is needed. However, that review is not final, as the registration of already reviewed `recipientId`, can be done by a regular member, and will reset the recipient status back to `Pending`. 

Since the strategy involves voting for recipients, lack of unanimity is inevitable. A member who disagrees with voting result may singlehandedly try to sabotage winning recipient, by registering the recipient after its reviewed, effectively changing its status back to `Pending`. If that member does this with right timing before the Registration ends, then he may effectively exclude that recipient from the voting phase and in turn, distribution of funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail
During the registration period, profile member (or privileged member) calls `BaseStrategy::registerRecipient` which calls [QVBaseStrategy::_registerRecipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L369).

Later, a manager reviews the registered candidates using [reviewRecipients](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L254) function and assigning them statuses. For an OK candidate, `Status.Accepted` is granted. `Status.Accepted` is required to be maintained over time until Registration period ends, so that recipientId can be voted on in Allocation phase and potentially got distributed funds in Distribution phase.

If now any member calls [_registerRecipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L419-L421) with the recipientId that already has accepted status, it will be reset to Pending. As per the comment, perhaps there are good intentions behind that code (to be able to update) however it can be easily abused. For possible solutions, please see "Recommendation" section.


## Impact
A regular profile member may abuse that utility to manipulate voting result leading to excluding recipients he doesn't want to pass to allocation/distribution phase.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        Status currentStatus = recipient.recipientStatus;

        if (currentStatus == Status.None) {
            // recipient registering new application
            recipient.recipientStatus = Status.Pending;
            emit Registered(recipientId, _data, _sender);
        } else {
            if (currentStatus == Status.Accepted) {//@audit regular member can use this maliciously
                // recipient updating accepted application
                recipient.recipientStatus = Status.Pending;
            } else if (currentStatus == Status.Rejected) {
                // recipient updating rejected application
                recipient.recipientStatus = Status.Appealed;
            }

            // emit the new status with the '_data' that was passed in
            emit UpdatedRegistration(recipientId, _data, _sender, recipient.recipientStatus);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I suggest one of two solutions here: 
- Either to disallow modifications of recipient status when its already `Accepted`; then if the registering member wants to update the submission, he should manually reach to `poolManager` and ask for rejection of previous one and just register a new recipient; 
- Or to save the `msg.sender` during registration of new recipient, and only allow the status changes, if current `msg.sender` matches the original one.
