# There is a potential flaw in the validation of the recipient address in the _validateDistribution function.
## Summary
The recipient, amount and other details checked may make sense at first glance but could be  flawed. The recipient address is not ensured to match the expected recipientId
## Vulnerability Detail
Specifically:
_validateDistribution checks that the distribution index, recipientId, recipient address, amount and merkle proof are valid. However, it does not verify that the recipientId matches the expected recipient address. There is no check that recipientId corresponds to _recipients[recipientId].recipientAddress
## Impact
- The merkle proof could be valid for a different recipientId and recipient address combination
- Funds can be distributed to an unintended address

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
_validateDistribution should also verify:
_recipients[recipientId].recipientAddress == _recipientAddress
This ensures the recipientId maps to the expected recipient address
