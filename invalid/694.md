# Excess sent ETH is never checked or returned
## Summary
There is no check in place to ensure msg.value does not exceed the amount required.
Some transactions which include NATIVE token (ETH) do not return excess ETH sent.

Might be a low.
## Vulnerability Detail
When paying the base fee (in ETH) or when performing any of the transfer functions (e.g. in fundPool), excess ETH that is sent as msg.value is not returned. e.g.:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L469-L474
Sending more ETH in msg.value than baseFee is results in ETH being absorbed in the contract.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/libraries/Transfer.sol#L28
All the transfer functions in the library also do not take excess ETH in account.

There is a way to retrieve these funds, via:
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L283

**But**, this can only retrieve all ETH in the contract instead of just a portion. Meaning it will burn unnecessary gas and requires a distribution system. 

## Impact
Excess ETH is not returned and needs to be recovered

## Recommendation
I would recommend one of the following:
1. ensure msg.value can not be greater than amount required
2. Check for excess eth after the transfer function and return it
