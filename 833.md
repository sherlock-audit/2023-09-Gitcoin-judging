# Allocations in `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionDirectTransferStrategy.sol` or `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol` can be manipulated to distribute more tokens to specific recepients
## Summary
Allocations in `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionDirectTransferStrategy.sol` or `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` can be manipulated to increase the payout of specific recipients in the distribution period.
## Vulnerability Detail
After the registering period in any strategy there will be the allocation phase where things are done different, depending on the strategy used. As can be seen by the Allo documentation,
https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/strategies/allocation 
the allocation phase for the `Donation voting` strategy involves directly donating to the specific recipients tokens that are allowed. After that in the distribution phase the payouts are proportional to the donations made

which means that if a recipients will get more donations in the allocation phase he will get more payouts in the distribution phase. The problem relies for the cases where `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionDirectTransferStrategy.sol` or `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol` are allowing any token to be used in the allocation phase by setting `allowedTokens` mapping to `address(0)`

When the allocation phase starts any address can allocate to a specific recipient, by donating any amount of tokens, which will first do some checks in `_allocate`

and then go trough the `_afterAllocate` hook. In both `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionDirectTransferStrategy.sol` and `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol` the `_afterAllocate` hook uses `permitTransferFrom` from `Permit2` used by Uniswap to transfer those specific tokens to the recipient himself, in the case of `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionDirectTransferStrategy.sol`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-distribution-direct-transfer/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionDirectTransferStrategy.sol#L59-L72 
or to the contract itself in the case of `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-distribution-vault/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol#L121-L131
The problem with using `permitTransferFrom` from `PERMIT2` is the fact that it uses the `SafeTransferLib` from solmate, as can be seen here 
https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2/blob/778de34c6e965f1fea1a82080122a7057c6f24ee/src/SignatureTransfer.sol#L7C9-L7C24
and `SafeTransferLib` from solmate doesn't check if the `token` address has any code at all 
https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/blob/fadb2e2778adbf01c80275bfb99e5c14969d964b/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol#L9
which means that if any token is allowed, anyone can allocate with a token which do not exist, to a specific recipient in very big quantities and the call will succeed. Because of that the whole distribution mechanism for `Donation voting` strategy can be easily manipulated and inflated by doing this multiple time, which will make it so a recipient could get a bigger share of the whole payout, since the payouts are calculated proportional to the donations, as stated in the Allo documentations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not let every token to be used in the allocation phase, force pool creators to allow only specific tokens for donations or when the allocation phase is happening check for the `codesize` of the token contract intended to be used by the allocators, in that way only token addresses with `codesize` can be used.
