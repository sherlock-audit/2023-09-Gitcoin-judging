# ALLO_OWNER role cannot be assigned to other users due to lack an admin role
ALLO_OWNER role cannot be assigned to other users due to lack an admin role.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Registry contract defines an ALLO_OWNER role and grants this role to the owner in the initialize() function. However, there is no designated admin for the ALLO_OWNER role, which prevents the ALLO_OWNER role from being assigned to other users.

## Impact
There is only one owner. If this user wishes to exit the project, it is not possible to transfer the owner role to a new user.
