# Redundant modifier onlyAllo
## Summary

Redundant Usage of onlyAllo Modifier in initialize Function

## Vulnerability Detail

The function has a modifier **onlyAllo** to ensure that only the **Allo** contract can invoke it. However, the same modifer exists in **__BaseStrategy_init** function.

## Impact

Although the redundant modifier doesn't present a direct security risk, it indicates that there might be some unnecessary complexity or misunderstanding in the contract's design. This can lead to maintainability issues, a larger gas cost for deploying or interacting with the contract, and potential confusion for developers.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the **onlyAllo** modifier from the initialize function to simplify the code and possibly reduce gas costs.
