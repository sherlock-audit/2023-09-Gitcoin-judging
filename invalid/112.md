# No strict check of `msg.value` in `_createPool` can result in loss of funds when `baseFee` is updated.

`_createPool` makes sure that `msg.value` is **HIGHER** then amount to fund and `baseFee`.
However - `baseFee` if updatable and can decrease. If a decreasing update is in the same block as a creation of a pool, the innocent pool creator will lose more `baseFee` then needed.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function _createPool(
        bytes32 _profileId,
        IStrategy _strategy,
        bytes memory _initStrategyData,
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        Metadata memory _metadata,
        address[] memory _managers
    ) internal returns (uint256 poolId) {
------
        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
------
    }

    function updateBaseFee(uint256 _baseFee) external onlyOwner {
        _updateBaseFee(_baseFee);
    }
```

As seen above in `_createPool` function - `msg.value` is checked to be above the `baseFee`.
If `updateBaseFee` is called in the same block. An innocent pool creator will not be aware of the change (since the block is not finalized and the creation can be after the update) and will send a `msg.value` with the previous `baseFee` (not a user error).

The funds will be accepted and not refunded.

In `_createPool` change the if statements as follows:
```solidity
        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount != msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee != msg.value)) {
                revert FUNDS_NOT_ACCURATE();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee); 
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
        else {
            if (_token != NATIVE && msg.value != 0) revert FUNDS_NOT_ACCURATE()
        }
```
