# reviewRecipients does not verify the set status

reviewRecipients does not verify the set status

## Vulnerability Detail

The position of status in statusBitMap is determined by recipientsCounter++. If it exceeds the range, it will affect _registerRecipient.

And if the value in fullRow is not in status (0, 1, 2, 3, 4), the status will not be processed.


## Impact

If the set state is outside the control range, the Recipient will not be able to enter the next state.

## Recommendation

Accurate judgment is more gas-intensive. You can judge the range and use bit operations to eliminate some of the unexpected results in fullRow, thereby reducing the possibility of exceptions.Consider exception status when handling status
