# Multiple allocations in QVSimpleStrategy with the same allocator and recipient result in recipient gaining more votes than intended

Incorrect accounting logic leads to recipients receiving more votes than intended when the same allocator allocates to them more than once.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `QVBaseStrategy._qv_allocate`, we find the sum of `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` and `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` to determine the correct amount of votes to provide the recipient. The problem is that we then increment `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` by this full amount when we should be setting it as this amount. Every subsequent allocation from the same allocator to the same recipient results in the total amount of credits increasing by what should be the new total, compounding the amount of credits the recipient receives. A malicious allocator can best manipulate this by allocating one voice credit per call until they reach their allocation limit.

## Impact

Recipient receives more credits, thus more votes and a larger proportional payout than intended.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];

...

uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;

...

// @audit should be setting this as totalCredits rather than incrementing
_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of incrementing `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` by `totalCredits`, we should just set it as `totalCredits`. e.g.

```solidity
_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] = totalCredits;
```
