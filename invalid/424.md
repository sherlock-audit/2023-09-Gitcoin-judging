# Implement Batch Fund Recovery in recoverFunds Function

The current implementation of the recoverFunds function in the Registry.sol contract allows the contract owner to recover all funds in a single transaction. For contracts holding a large amount of funds, this can result in high gas costs. To improve gas efficiency during fund recovery, we suggest implementing batch fund recovery.

## Vulnerability Detail

The existing recoverFunds function performs fund recovery in a single batch, which may lead to high gas costs for contracts with a substantial fund balance. This can impact the usability and cost-effectiveness of the contract, particularly in situations where the contract owner needs to recover funds in smaller portions.

## Impact

The current implementation may lead to increased gas costs for fund recovery, potentially affecting the contract's overall gas efficiency and usability.

## Code Snippet

Here's a snippet of the relevant code:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L384

```solidity
function recoverFunds(address _token, address _recipient) external onlyRole(ALLO_OWNER) {
        if (_recipient == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

        uint256 amount = _token == NATIVE ? address(this).balance : ERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
        _transferAmount(_token, _recipient, amount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend enhancing the recoverFunds function to support batch fund recovery, allowing the contract owner to recover funds in smaller portions. This can significantly reduce gas costs for fund recovery and improve the contract's overall gas efficiency.

### Proposed Solution:

- Modify the recoverFunds function to accept an additional parameter _batchCount, which specifies the number of batches to recover.
- Introduce state variables to track the current batch index and batch size.
- Implement a loop to iterate through the specified number of batches, transferring funds in each batch.
- Allow the contract owner to set the batch size via a separate function (setBatchSize) to provide flexibility in adjusting batch sizes as needed.

The proposed code changes are as follows:
```solidity
// Track the current batch index and batch size
uint256 private currentBatchIndex;
uint256 private batchSize = 100; // Adjust the batch size as needed

/// @notice Transfers a batch of funds from Allo to the recipient
/// @dev 'msg.sender' must be the Allo owner
/// @param _token The address of the token to transfer
/// @param _recipient The address of the recipient
/// @param _batchCount The number of batches to recover
function recoverFunds(address _token, address _recipient, uint256 _batchCount) external onlyRole(ALLO_OWNER) {
    if (_recipient == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

    uint256 totalBalance = (_token == NATIVE) ? address(this).balance : ERC20(_token).balanceOf(address(this));

    // Loop through the specified number of batches
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _batchCount; i++) {
        uint256 startIdx = currentBatchIndex * batchSize;
        uint256 endIdx = (currentBatchIndex + 1) * batchSize;

        if (startIdx >= totalBalance) {
            // All funds have been recovered
            break;
        }

        uint256 amountToRecover = (endIdx > totalBalance) ? totalBalance - startIdx : batchSize;

        _transferAmount(_token, _recipient, amountToRecover);

        currentBatchIndex++;
    }
}

/// @notice Set the batch size for fund recovery
/// @dev Only the contract owner can update the batch size
/// @param _newBatchSize The new batch size to set
function setBatchSize(uint256 _newBatchSize) external onlyRole(ALLO_OWNER) {
    batchSize = _newBatchSize;
}
```
