# For all strategies, if the recipient address is a contract that can not handle the pool tokens, the pool tokens will be lost for ever

When registering a recipient, the recipient address can be a contract that cannot handle the pool tokens. If this is the case and pool tokens are sent to this contract, the pool tokens will be lost. 


## Vulnerability Detail
When registering a recipient, it is not checked if the provided recipient address is a EOA or a contract. This means a contract that cannot handle the pool token can be registered as a recipient address. If this is the case and pool tokens are sent to this contract, the pool tokens will be lost since the contract has no way to interact with the pool tokens. For example, a project might add their central DAO contract as the receiver address but the contract might not be able to receive native tokens or handle any other tokens send to it. 


## Impact

All tokens sent to receiver addresses that are contracts and that can not handle the tokens will be lost for ever

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only allow EOA to be set as recipient addresses by checking if the code size of the address is 0. Alternatively implement a callback to the recipient address if it is a contract, equal to the callback in the ERC721TokenReceiver interface, that confirms that the contract can handle any tokens send to it.
