# Allocation logic in `QVSimpleStrategy.sol` contract allows an allocator to infinitely allocate voice credits
Allocation logic in `QVSimpleStrategy.sol` contract allows an allocator to infinitely allocate voice credits without any decrements or limits, bypassing the intended limit set by `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation of allocation logic in `QVSimpleStrategy.sol` contract lacks the mechanism to decrement or update the `voiceCredits` of an `Allocator` after they've allocated votes to recipients. Specifically, after the allocation process in `_qv_allocate`, the allocator's total voice credits (`voiceCredits`) remain unchanged, leading to the potential for unchecked and unlimited allocations.

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to an allocator having an undue influence in the allocation process, allocating an unbounded number of voice credits. It defeats the purpose of having a max limit per allocator and can compromise the fairness and integrity of the vote allocation system.

I think that the impact should be `High`, because the vulnerability leads to:
- `Unlimited Influence`
- `Integrity of the System`: Quadratic voting is designed to reflect the preferences of the group in a balanced way. If one participant can allocate without limits, it violates the fundamental principles of the system and can skew outcomes heavily in favor of a particular recipient or a set of recipients.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's crucial to implement a mechanism that decrements the `voiceCredits` of the `Allocator` after they allocate their votes. This can be done directly in the `_qv_allocate` function:

1. Decrement `_allocator.voiceCredits` by the amount `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` after votes have been allocated.
2. Implement checks to ensure that an allocator cannot allocate more voice credits than they have remaining.

By ensuring that each allocation decrements the allocator's available voice credits, we can uphold the integrity and fairness of the allocation system.
