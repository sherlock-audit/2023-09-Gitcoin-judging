# Missing nonReentrant checks
## Summary

he createPoolWithCustomStrategy  functions lack a reentrancy guard, which may expose the contract to potential reentrancy attacks.
https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/main/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L144

## Vulnerability Detail
The absence of a reentrancy guard in these functions means that an external attacker could potentially exploit them to perform reentrant calls, allowing them to manipulate the contract's state in unintended ways.

Medium

## Impact
Without proper reentrancy protection, an attacker could exploit these function to perform malicious actions, such as draining funds or disrupting the contract's intended behavior. This could result in financial losses or other unexpected behavior in the contract.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// Vulnerable function without reentrancy guard
function createPoolWithCustomStrategy(
    bytes32 _profileId,
    address _strategy,
    bytes memory _initStrategyData,
    address _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    Metadata memory _metadata,
    address[] memory _managers
) external payable returns (uint256 poolId) {
 
    return _createPool(_profileId, IStrategy(_strategy), _initStrategyData, _token, _amount, _metadata, _managers);
}

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address the reentrancy vulnerability in the createPoolWithCustomStrategy functions, consider adding a reentrancy guard at the beginning of each function.
