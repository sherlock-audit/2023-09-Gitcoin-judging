# QVBaseStrategy.sol#_distribute() Distributed amount is not subtracted from the poolAmount variable which leads to stuck of funds
Distributed amount is not subtracted from the poolAmount variable which leads to revert

## Vulnerability Detail
The distributed amount in _distribute function is not subtracted from the poolAmount variable which is not a problem for the first distribute, but every second distribution would revert. 

For example, poolAmount = 100 and pool manager executes _distribute. The pool manager funds the pool with a new 100 and executes _distribute() again. Since the first 100 distributions were not subtracted from the poolAmount, now poolAmount = 200. The pool manager wants to distribute 50% of the pool amount to one person, 30% to the second person, and 20% to the third person. 50% from 100 is 50, but as the poolAmount is 200 so 50% would be 100. As that's all of the pool's amount, there is nothing left for the second and third person so the transaction would fail and revert.

## Impact
The function would revert and the funds would be stuck in the pool.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function _distribute(address[] memory _recipientIds, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
        onlyAfterAllocation
    {
        uint256 payoutLength = _recipientIds.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < payoutLength;) {
            address recipientId = _recipientIds[i];
            Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];

            PayoutSummary memory payout = _getPayout(recipientId, "");
            uint256 amount = payout.amount;

            if (paidOut[recipientId] || !_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId) || amount == 0) {
                revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
            }

            IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
            _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

            paidOut[recipientId] = true;

            emit Distributed(recipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }

## Recommendation
Subtract the distributed amount
