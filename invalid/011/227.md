# Stucked ETH in VotingMerkleDistributionStrategy contract
## Summary
In `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionDirectTransferStrategy` there is a `receive()` function to accept native tokens, but there is no way to get those funds out of the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
`DonationVotingMerkleDistributionDirectTransferStrategy` is the parent contract and neither of its child has a functionallity to do something with the contract's balance.
There is a receive function to accept ETH from any address and from any call, where signature does not match existing methods.
```solidity
   /// @notice Contract should be able to receive ETH
    receive() external payable {}
```
But such functionallity is not needed and could only lead to stucked resources.
## Impact
- Stucked native tokens in strategy contract.

## Recommendation
