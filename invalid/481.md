# Unable to remove pool manager from pool if pool manager become malicious
When pool manager of pool become malicious, any attempt to remove pool manager from pool is not able by front-running

## Vulnerability Detail
In `Allo#_createPool`, `POOL_MANAGER_ROLE` is granted admin role:

        // Set admin role for POOL_MANAGER_ROLE
        _setRoleAdmin(POOL_MANAGER_ROLE, POOL_ADMIN_ROLE);
Which mean that any function that have `onlyPoolAdmin` can be called by poolManager:

    function addPoolManager(uint256 _poolId, address _manager) external onlyPoolAdmin(_poolId) {
        // Reverts if the address is the zero address with 'ZERO_ADDRESS()'
        if (_manager == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

        // Grants the pool manager role to the '_manager' address
        _grantRole(pools[_poolId].managerRole, _manager);
    }

    function removePoolManager(uint256 _poolId, address _manager) external onlyPoolAdmin(_poolId) {
        _revokeRole(pools[_poolId].managerRole, _manager);
    }
When pool manager become malicious, any attempt to remove malicious address can be bypassed by front running and add another address that controlled by him as PoolManager by `addPoolManager` function

## Impact
Malicious pool manager can keep having role in the pool
