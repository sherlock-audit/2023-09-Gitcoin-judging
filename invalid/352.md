# A nonReentrant function should not call one another
A nonReentrant function should not call one another as in seen in batchRegisterRecipient and registerRecipient functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Allo contract implemented Openzeppelin's Upgradeable ReentrancyGuard.

Both batchRegisterRecipient and registerRecipient functions are external functions marked "nonReentrant". And the batchRegisterRecipient function calls the registerRecipient function.

However, here's what the Openzeppelin's documentation says about  functions marked "nonReentrant" calling each other in a contract: 

"Note that because there is a single nonReentrant guard, functions marked as nonReentrant may not call one another. This can be worked around by making those functions private, and then adding external nonReentrant entry points to them." See: https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/security#ReentrancyGuard

## Impact
Reentrancy can occur.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make one function private and the other external nonReentrant as suggested in the Openzeppelin's documentation.
