# "Pool Admin" role cannot be assigned to other users due to lack an admin role
"Pool Admin" role cannot be assigned to other users due to lack an admin role

## Vulnerability Detail
In a pool, there are two roles: POOL_MANAGER_ROLE and POOL_ADMIN_ROLE. POOL_ADMIN_ROLE serves as the administrator for POOL_MANAGER_ROLE. However, there is no administrative role designated for POOL_ADMIN_ROLE, which means that POOL_ADMIN_ROLE cannot be assigned to other users.

## Impact
In the pool, there is only one admin user. If this user wishes to exit the project, it is not possible to transfer the admin privileges to a new manager.
