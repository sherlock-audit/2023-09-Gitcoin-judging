# Creating a Pool Expects Amount Greater than Intended baseFee + amount
## Summary
If baseFee > 0, users should always overpay due to issues within the _createPool function:
```solidity
if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            // @audit the rule is that msg.value should always be grater than the necessary amount. 
            // If base fee is 10 and amount is 100, then msg.value of 110 should be enough, but the transaction will revert and will always 
            // expect payment in advance.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }

            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
```
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies here: (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value). The comment is misleading because the statement baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value is not accurate. If it is greater than msg.value, paying the baseFee would be done from the Allo balance. The same inequality is presented inside the if statement, which defines when to revert. However, using = causes the function to revert every time a user provides exactly the required baseFee, which is not the intended behavior.

## Impact
This issue results in poor user experience and unintended contract behavior. Users are required to pay more from their accounts than necessary.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The recommendation is to remove the = from inside the if statement:
```solidity
 if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
```
