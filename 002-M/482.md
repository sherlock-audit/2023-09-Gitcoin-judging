# `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` deos not work if one of the allowed tokens is a fee on transfer token
## Summary

If one of the tokens allowed in a `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` is a fee on transfer token, vault will hold less tokens than the sum of all claims for this token. This will result in not everyone being able to claim the amount of tokens that were donated to them.


## Vulnerability Detail

In the `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` users can allocate tokens to accepted recipients by calling `allocate`. When allocating tokens to a recipient, the amount of tokens specified by the user is send to the vault/strategy and the claims mapping, an overview of the amount of tokens a recipient is allowed to claim, is uncreased by the amount of tokens send to the vault. 

The problem arises when the token is a fee on demand token. Such tokens take a fee each time tokens are moved from one account to another. This means that the amount send to the vault is not the amount the pool finally receives but `the amount sent - fee`. For example if the fee taken on transfer is 2% and one sends 100 tokens the amount claimable by the recipient will be increased by 100 but the tokens held by the vault will be 100-2=98. 

This will result in problems when all recipients want to claim the tokens donated to them since the amount of tokens held by the pool will not be able to cover the sum of all claims. 

Example:

Alice allocates in a `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` 100 fee on demand token with a fee of 2% to Bob. Bobs claim for the token will be 100 tokens but once Alice sends the 100 tokens to the vault, only 98 tokens will find their way to the pool. This means that Bob will not be able to claim his tokens since he can only claim 100% of the tokens allocated to him. 


## Impact

At least one recipient will not be able to get the tokens allocated to them resulting in additional cost for the pool owner if he wants to honer all claims. E.g. if the token has a 2% transaction fee and the sum of all claims for the fee on transfer token is 10.000 tokens, the owner will need to come up with additional 200 tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the amount of tokens held by the vault before and after the transfer and increase the claim for the recipient by the amount the holdings of the vault increased by transfer.
