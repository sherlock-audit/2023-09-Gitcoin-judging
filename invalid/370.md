# The access control in updateDistribution() can potentially be bypassed by an attacker
The access control in updateDistribution() can potentially be bypassed by an attacker.
## Vulnerability Detail
The updateDistribution() function has the following modifier: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L422-L423). This requires that:
   1. The allocation period has ended
   2. msg.sender is a pool manager
   
However, there is a logic flaw that could allow the pool manager check to be bypassed:
The _checkOnlyActiveAllocation modifier only checks: [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L466-L467)

It does NOT check that msg.sender is a pool manager.
An attacker could exploit this by:
1. Waiting until after official allocationEndTime
2. Calling updateDistribution() directly without being a pool manager
Since onlyAfterAllocation passes, the unauthorized user can update the distribution.


## Impact
This flaw allows anyone to update the distribution after allocation ends. Attackers could wrongly set the merkle root and distribution metadata. This could disrupt the intended payouts

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
The proper fix is to move the pool manager check outside the modifiers. This ensures the manager check occurs before the allocation timing check.
The manager check should also use an access control list instead of isPoolManager() for better security.
