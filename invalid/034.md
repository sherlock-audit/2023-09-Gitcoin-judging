# Missing Check for Zero Amount

https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/main/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L144
 the  createPoolWithCustomStrategy function is missing checks to prevent adding 0 amounts.

label: Low

## Vulnerability Detail
The code does not currently check whether the _amount parameter passed to createPoolWithCustomStrategy is zero. This means that a user could potentially create a pool with no initial deposit, which might not be the intended behavior.

## Impact
The impact of this issue could result in unintended behavior, allowing users to create pools with no initial deposit.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function createPoolWithCustomStrategy(
    bytes32 _profileId,
    address _strategy,
    bytes calldata _initStrategyData,
    address _token,
    uint256 _amount,
    Metadata memory _metadata,
    address[] memory _managers
) external payable returns (uint256 poolId) {
    // Revert if the strategy address passed is the zero address with 'ZERO_ADDRESS()'
    if (_strategy == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

    // Revert if _amount is zero
    if (_amount == 0) revert AMOUNT_ZERO(); // You can define this custom error code as needed

    // Revert if we already have this strategy in our cloneable mapping with 'IS_APPROVED_STRATEGY()' (only non-cloneable strategies can be used)
    if (_isCloneableStrategy(_strategy)) revert IS_APPROVED_STRATEGY();

    // Call the internal '_createPool()' function and return the pool ID
    return _createPool(_profileId, IStrategy(_strategy), _initStrategyData, _token, _amount, _metadata, _managers);
}

```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address the issue of zero amounts being used to create pools, you should include the check for _amount == 0 as shown in the code snippet above. Additionally, you can define a custom error code like AMOUNT_ZERO() to provide a clear error message when the condition is met.
