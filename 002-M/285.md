# Contracts do not work with fee-on-transfer tokens

Contracts do not work with fee-on-transfer tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

Some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. STA, PAXG), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. USDT, USDC).

## Impact

## Code Snippet

```solidity

512:            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));

515:            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));

```

```solidity

482:         _transferAmount(token, address(this), amount);

## Recommendation
Recommended Mitigation Steps
    Consider comparing before and after balance to get the actual transferred amount.
    Alternatively, disallow tokens with fee-on-transfer mechanics to be added as tokens.
