# `Anchor.execute()` should be payable

`Anchor.execute()` is not payable and therefor can not handle any call involving msg.value > 0



## Vulnerability Detail

`Anchor.execute()` is used to execute any type of call to a contract including calls to contracts that require a certain amount of native token send ( msg.value >0) seen on the use of {value: _value}.
The problem is that the function `Anchor.execute()` is not payable and will therefore revert every time msg.value >0.



## Impact

Every call where msg.value > 0 will revert
