# registerRecipient may not work as expected
## Summary
https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L301-L304

Users may lose funds when calling the `registerRecipient` function since it has payable modifier but it is not sending the sent value to the strategy with the call.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Allo contract `registerRecipient` function has `payable` modifier but it doesn't use the sent value. If a user want to register a new recipient on their custom strategy contract which requires some value be sent with the call they can't since you don't send the `msg.value` with the call in the Allo contract.

Or if a pool is using your default strategies which doesn't require any msg.value for registering a recipient, If they call `Allo.sol::registerRecipient` function with some ETH sent their eth will be locked in the contract since the function is payable but not caching the msg.value for user anywhere or using at as fee

## Impact

User's sent funds may be lost via the call to `registerRecipient` or they may be unable to send funds to `registerRecipient` function in their custom strategy contract
(Note : the sent value will be locked in Allo not strategy, means it is not recoverable)

## Code Snippet
Allo.sol which doent't send the msg.value with the call :
```solidity
File: allo-v2\contracts\core\Allo.sol
301:     function registerRecipient(uint256 _poolId, bytes memory _data) external payable nonReentrant returns (address) {
302:         // Return the recipientId (address) from the strategy
303:         return pools[_poolId].strategy.registerRecipient(_data, msg.sender);
304:     }
```
BaseStrategy.sol :
```solidity
File: allo-v2\contracts\strategies\BaseStrategy.sol
165:     function registerRecipient(bytes memory _data, address _sender)
166:         external
167:         payable
168:         onlyAllo
169:         onlyInitialized
170:         returns (address recipientId)
171:     {
172:         _beforeRegisterRecipient(_data, _sender);
173:         recipientId = _registerRecipient(_data, _sender);
174:         _afterRegisterRecipient(_data, _sender);
175:     }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the `payable` to prevent user's from losing funds if they sent with the call accidentally Or send the `msg.value` with call to strategy contract and also make sure your default strategy contracts are using the sent value otherwise remove payable from the `registerRecipient` in strategy contract too
