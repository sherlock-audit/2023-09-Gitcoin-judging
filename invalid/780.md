# The Owner can update a `feePercent` equal to 1e18 (100%)
The Owner can update a `feePercent` equal to 1e18 leading to set a `feePercent` which is equivalent to 100% of the funding amount which will end up using all the funding amount as `percentFee`.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `allo.sol` and function `updatePercentFee`:
```solidity
    function _updatePercentFee(uint256 _percentFee) internal {
        if (_percentFee > 1e18) revert INVALID_FEE();

        percentFee = _percentFee;

        emit PercentFeeUpdated(percentFee);
    }
```
The `_percentFee` can be updated equal to 1e18 which equivalent to the 100% of the pool funding amount. This will lead to not transferring any fund to the pool and funding amount will end up as `percentFee`. This means that the Owner of pool can harm the funds of liquidity providers taking the full funding amount as `percentFee`. 

The provided doc says that the `percentFee` should be less than the 100%(1e18) 
> percentFee (Private): This variable holds the fee percentage applied to transactions within pools. It's represented as a fraction of 1e18, where 1e18 equals 100%.

## Impact
The funding will be end up as `percentFee` not transferring any amount to the pool.

## Recommendation
Add this line to the function to avoid this happen:
```solidity
    function _updatePercentFee(uint256 _percentFee) internal {
-       if (_percentFee > 1e18) revert INVALID_FEE();
+       if (_percentFee >= 1e18) revert INVALID_FEE();

        percentFee = _percentFee;

        emit PercentFeeUpdated(percentFee);
    }
```
