# Misuse of operaton signs (>=) in _createePool function will cause createPool and createPoolWithCustomStrategy functions to revert
## Summary
Misuse of operaton signs (>=) in _createePool function will cause createPool and createPoolWithCustomStrategy to revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
baseFee and _amount are suppose to be greater than or equal to msg.value when added together. And when this is the case, it shouldn't revert with "NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS()", as there are actually enough funds. 

However, in the affected line (473), when baseFee and _amount are added together and greater than or equal to msg.value, both createPool and createPoolWithCustomStrategy functions, which call the _createPool inaternal function, will revert. The cause of this is the misuse of the operation signs  ">=" in the internal _createPool function.

When baseFee plus _amount are greater than or equal to msg.value, it means there are enough funds.
 
## Impact
createPool and createPoolWithCustomStrategy functions will revert when baseFee and _amount are greater than or equal to msg.value.
