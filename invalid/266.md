# No Interface Validation for Strategy Contracts in Allo.sol
The Allo.sol contract allows the integration of custom-made external strategy contracts. However there are no validation mechanisms to ascertain that these strategies adhere to the expected IStrategy interface, specifically the methods and behaviors defined in the BaseStrategy contract. This opens the door to potential vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail

Function createPoolWithCustomStrategy: This function enables users to establish a new pool using a custom strategy, that is a Strategy that utilizes a contract made by the pool creator. At the function in question, the provided _strategy address is accepted without validating its conformity to the IStrategy interface. This allows any address, regardless of its functions and behaviors, to be set as a strategy.

Function addToCloneableStrategies: This function marks an address as a cloneable strategy. However, it also lacks validation against the IStrategy interface, posing risks, especially if multiple clones of a faulty strategy are created.

Funding Pools Interactions: During the pool funding procedure, interactions with external strategy contracts occur. Without sufficient checks, this could result in reversions or other unexpected behaviors, such as loss of tokens.

## Impact

Unpredictable System Behavior: Utilizing strategies not adhering to the IStrategy interface can cause system errors, transaction halts, or unforeseen results.
Funds Lockup: If a strategy does not implement the correct withdrawal or asset management methods, assets in the pool may become irrevocably locked. Pool owners and managers may be unable to retrieve or reallocate these funds, leading to financial losses.

## Code Snippet
[createPoolWithCustomStrategy function:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L144-L161)
```solidity
function createPoolWithCustomStrategy(
        bytes32 _profileId,
        address _strategy,
        bytes memory _initStrategyData,
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        Metadata memory _metadata,
        address[] memory _managers
    ) external payable returns (uint256 poolId) {
        // Revert if the strategy address passed is the zero address with 'ZERO_ADDRESS()'
        if (_strategy == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

        // Revert if we already have this strategy in our cloneable mapping with 'IS_APPROVED_STRATEGY()' (only non-cloneable strategies can be used)
        if (_isCloneableStrategy(_strategy)) revert IS_APPROVED_STRATEGY();

        // Call the internal '_createPool()' function and return the pool ID
        return _createPool(_profileId, IStrategy(_strategy), _initStrategyData, _token, _amount, _metadata, _managers);
    }
```
[addToCloneableStrategies function:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L241-L246) 
```solidity
function addToCloneableStrategies(address _strategy) external onlyOwner {
        if (_strategy == address(0)) revert ZERO_ADDRESS();

        cloneableStrategies[_strategy] = true;
        emit StrategyApproved(_strategy);
    }
```
Notice neither functions call the strategy contract to attest it's proper interface implementation.
This enables supposed strategies to be the target of all sort of calls related to an allocation pool: from naive calls that don't really result in anything other than reversion, to more sensitive areas located in payable calls such as:
[_allocate:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L492-L494)
```solidity
function _allocate(uint256 _poolId, bytes memory _data) internal {
        pools[_poolId].strategy.allocate{value: msg.value}(_data, msg.sender);
    }

```

And [_fundPool:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L502-L520)
```solidity
function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Prior to strategy integration, validate its adherence to the defined interface using the standard  EIP-165 supportsInterface function or specific calls to getter methods at the contract, such as getAllo().
