# Standard version of `AccessControl` in upgradeable contracts
A standard version of the `AccessControl` is used in `Allo` and `Registry`, which is intended to be upgradable. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`Allo` and `Registry` use `openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol` instead of the upgradeable version `openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol`.
While it is true that `AccessControl` doesn't have an initializer function, it still may be affected by a storage collision because the standard version of `AccessControl` and its underlying dependencies don't implement storage gaps. An upgrade of OpenZeppelin's libraries may lead to a storage collision.

Official docs about the use of upgradeable versions of contracts:

https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable

## Impact
Possible storage collision during an upgrade.
