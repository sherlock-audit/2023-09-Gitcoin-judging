# Removing an allocator doesn't prevent them from submitting further allocations. It just flips their "allowed" mapping to false. Their previous allocations still stand.
## Summary
The current logic does not prevent previous influence by removed allocators
## Vulnerability Detail
1. The allowedAllocators mapping tracks which addresses are permitted to allocate voice credits: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L47)
2. When an allocator is removed via removeAllocator(), it simply sets their allowedAllocators entry to false: [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L97-L101)
3. However, this does NOT revoke any previous allocations they made when allowedAllocators[_allocator] was true. The _allocate() function only checks if they are allowed at the time of the call: [Link3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L115) and [Link 4](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L136-L137)

So a removed allocator could still impact votes if they had previously allocated a large number of credits that remain assigned to recipients.


## Impact
- This can allow abuse by allocators allocating a lot up front before being removed.
- A removed allocator could still influence votes and outcomes based on their prior allocations.

## Recommendation
Allocation amounts could be stored per allocator and reset on removal
