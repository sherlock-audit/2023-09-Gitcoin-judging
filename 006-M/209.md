# Incorrect check in RFPSimpleStrategy#_distribute lead to function unintended fail in some case
Due to incorrect checking condition at RFPSimpleStrategy#_distribute, function can be unintended fail in some case

## Vulnerability Detail
In RFPSimpleStrategy#_distribute, there is a check to make sure pool has enough funds to transfer:

    if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
But in fact, the actual amount to transfer is smaller than `recipient.proposalBid`:

        uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;

        // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
        poolAmount -= amount;
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
The actual `amount` that will be used to transfer can be smaller than `recipient.proposalBid` when `milestone.amountPercentage` is smaller than 1e18 (which is 100%). Which lead to function can be unintended fail when `amount` < `poolAmount` < `(recipient.proposalBid`

## Impact
Function can be failed in some cases

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace checking condition to:

        -   if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
        +   if (((recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18) > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
