# Percentage Fee can be avoided when a pool uses an ERC20 token
The *percentage fee* charged by the Allo protocol when funding a pool can be avoided by a pool manager. The pool can be created with any ERC20 token and the percentage fee is collected as this token. A pool manager can create a pool with a custom ERC20 that implements transfers to succeed but not actually perform a transfer if the recipient is the Allo treasury.

## Vulnerability Detail
Steps to produce:
1. Create an ERC20 token contract that skips transfers if recipient == Allo.treasury
2. Create a pool that uses this ERC20 token
3. Call `fundPool()` of any approved amount
4. Only `amountAfterFee` will be transferred and treasury balance does not increase

## Impact
This breaks functionality of the Allo protocol and can result in a large loss of protocol revenue. This only impacts the admin of the Allo protocol and not other pools, pool managers, or participants in a pool.

## Code Snippet

`pool.token` can be set in `createPool()` to any address. No checks exist in `_fundPool()` to ensure `percentFee` is actually collected.

https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/main/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L513

```solidity
function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Some possible mitigations:
- `percentFee` can be collected as a native token, similar to `baseFee`. This would require an oracle to determine the value of any arbitrary ERC20 token
- A list a pre-approved, trusted ERC20 tokens could be added which pool managers must choose from
- `_fundPool()` could check the balance of `Allo.sol` in the ERC20 token before and after collection to ensure the fee was collected properly, instead of only relying on the successful return of `_transferAmountFrom`
