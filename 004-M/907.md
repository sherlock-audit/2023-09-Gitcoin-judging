# wrong vote calculation
in the function QVBaseStrategy._qv_allocate when updating the vote it the calculation is wrong


## Vulnerability Detail
in the function qv_allocate line 529 when updating the _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient it is adding the value twice it is adding the previous _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient and the new amount the user allocated plus the previous _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient

line  521  `uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;`
voiceCreditsToAllocate is the new allocated vote the user wanted to allocate 
creditsCastToRecipient is  _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
which mean totalcredits is the new vote plus the previous one this should be fine but in line 529 it is adding the totalcredit to the allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient 
`  _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;`
