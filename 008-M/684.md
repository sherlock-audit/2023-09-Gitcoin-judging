# Any member of profile can submit upcoming milestone in RFPSimpleStrategy.sol
Due to bad logic checking in `submitUpcomingMilestone`, any member of profile can submit upcoming milestone in RFPSimpleStrategy.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
In `submitUpcomingMilestone` function, developer noted that:

    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be the 'acceptedRecipientId' and must be a member
    ///      of a 'Profile' to sumbit a milestone. Emits a 'MilestonesSubmitted()' event.

But it is not true, this is checking condition in the function:

        if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender && !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)) {
            revert UNAUTHORIZED();
        }

In this checking condition, it will only revert when both two conditions are met, which mean msg.sender is profile member of `acceptedRecipientId` is enough to pass this check.
## Impact
Any member of `acceptedRecipientId` can submit upcoming milestone

## Recommendation
Change checking condition to:

        if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender || !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender))
