# The contract upgrade will render the strategy unavailable
Since Allo.sol is a upgradeable contract , after upgrade the address of allo would be changed. But in BaseStrategy  contract the address of allo is immutable .Therefore after upgrade proxyContract can't interact with some BaseStrategy that marked as modifier `onlyAllo`.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L48#L51


## Impact
All contracts inheriting from BaseStrategy will become unusable after the upgradeã€‚

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    IAllo internal immutable allo;  //@audit <--------------------- immutable 
    bytes32 internal immutable strategyId;
    bool internal poolActive;
    uint256 internal poolId;
    uint256 internal poolAmount;

    /// ====================================
    /// ========== Constructor =============
    /// ====================================

    /// @notice Constructor to set the Allo contract and "strategyId'.
    /// @param _allo Address of the Allo contract.
    /// @param _name Name of the strategy
    constructor(address _allo, string memory _name) {
        allo = IAllo(_allo);
        strategyId = keccak256(abi.encode(_name));
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
allo should not be marked as immutable, and a function should be provided to modify the address of allo
