# The pool's active status can be updated by anyone.
In RFPSimpleStrategy, anyone can modify the active status of a pool, rendering the strategy vulnerable.

## Vulnerability Detail

This makes the strategy unstable and unreliable, with a possibility of being unable to access funds if random individuals change this flag. '_allocate' only works when the pool is active, while '_distribute' only works when the pool is inactive
