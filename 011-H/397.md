# Malicious recipient can frontrun `allocate` with a call to `registerRecipient`
Consider a strategy deployed with `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol`. A malicious recipient can first register themselves with a low proposal bid, wait for one of the pool managers to call `allocate` on `Allo.sol` to make the malicious recipient the `acceptedRecipientId` (tricked by the low proposal bid). The malicious recipient will then frontrun this call to `allocate` with another call to `_registerRecipient` with a higher `proposalBid`. 

## Vulnerability Detail

It's smartest for the attacker to first start by calling `registerRecipient` on `Allo.sol` (which calls `_registerRecipient` on `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol`) with a low proposal bid. Eventually, the pool manager will call `allocate` to assign the attacker as the `acceptedRecipientId` since the proposal bid was very low. The attacker then front-runs this call to `allocate` with a call to `_registerRecipient` with a higher proposal bid (everything else can be the same as in the original call). This essentially griefs the pool manager because they cannot select another recipient to be the `acceptedRecipientId`, as the pool has been deactivated. So, they have to choose between working with the attacker for a high price or just abandoning the pool / strategy by calling `withdraw`. 

## Impact

Malicious recipient can grief the pool manager, putting them in a situation where they must work with the attacker for a higher price or abandon the pool / strategy by calling `withdraw`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One idea is to implement a timeframe during which `_registerRecipient` can be called, and then another timeframe strictly afterwards during which `_allocate` can be called.
