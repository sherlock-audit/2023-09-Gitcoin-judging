# An allocator might allocate ``voiceCredits`` without any limit, exceeding ``maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`` due to forgetting  to increase allocator.voiceCredits.
## Summary
Each alllocator can allocate at most ``maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`` voiceCredits. The amount of voiceCredits that have been allocated so far
is maintained in ``allocator.voiceCredits``. Therefore, each time when some voiceCredits are allocated, ``allocator.voiceCredits`` should be increased by that amount. Unfortunately, ``QVSimpleStrategy._allocate()`` never increases ``allocator.voiceCredits``. As a result, in total, 
an allocator can effectively allocate voiceCredits without any limit. A violation of ``maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`` will occur. 

## Vulnerability Detail
QVSimpleStrategy._allocate() allows a sender to allocate voiceCredit to  a recipient:

It invokes ``QVBaseStrategy._qv_allocate()`` to achieve this: 

[https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L506C14-L534](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L506C14-L534)

It is important to ensure that each alllocator can allocate at most ``maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`` voiceCredits. This is checked by ``_hasVoiceCreditsLeft()``:

[https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L144C7-L151](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L144C7-L151)

where ``allocator.voiceCredits`` maitains the voiceCredits used so far for the allocator. 

Unfortunately, neither ``QVSimpleStrategy._allocate()`` nor ``QVBaseStrategy._qv_allocate()``
increases ``allocator.voiceCredits``. In other words, ``allocator.voiceCredits`` will always be zero. 

Therefore, each allocator can allocate up to ``maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`` voiceCredits, but the number of allocations and the total of allocation have no limit. In total, an allocator can allocate more than ``maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`` voiceCredits. A violation. 

## Impact
In total, an allocator can allocate more than ``maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`` voiceCredits. A violation.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We need to update ``allocator.voiceCredits += voiceCreditsToAllocate;`` when calling ``_allocate``: 

```diff
 function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal virtual override {
        (address recipientId, uint256 voiceCreditsToAllocate) = abi.decode(_data, (address, uint256));

        // spin up the structs in storage for updating
        Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
        Allocator storage allocator = allocators[_sender];

        // check that the sender can allocate votes
        if (!_isValidAllocator(_sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();

        // check that the recipient is accepted
        if (!_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId)) revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);

        // check that the recipient has voice credits left to allocate
        if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();

+     allocator.voiceCredits += voiceCreditsToAllocate;

        _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
    }
```
