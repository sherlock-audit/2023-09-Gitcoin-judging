# Lack of access control in setPoolActive function
## Summary
Lack of access control in setPoolActive function

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can change a pool from active to inactive by calling the `setPoolActive` function in the `RFPSimpleStrategy` contract. However, it should be noted that in the comment above,` msg.sender` is expected to be the pool manager. Due to a lack of access control, anyone can modify the `poolActive` state to either true or false.

## Impact
Unwanted behavior for pool manager. 

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219

```solidity
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external { //@audit-issue H: access control, see dev comment
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` modifier.
