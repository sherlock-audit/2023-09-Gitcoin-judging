# Users may lose funds while creating a pool
https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L473-L476

User may lose funds due to bad validation and no refund functionality in Allo.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

In `_createPool` function if there is a base fee it is required `msg.value > amoun + baseFee`, this leads to user lose funds if they send more ETH accidentally (because you only transfer the baseFee to treasury and the specified amount to strategy if the msg.value is bigger the remainder will be lost).

You also revert if msg.value is == to the expected amount since your check is  `if( amount + baseFee >= msg.value) revert;` , this means user should always send 1 more wei to pass this validataion, so there is possibility user sends more assets than expected and they lose the remainder.

## Impact

User will lose some funds if they send more than expected.

## Code Snippet
_createPool function :
```solidity
File: allo-v2\contracts\core\Allo.sol

469:         if (baseFee > 0) {
470:             // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
471:             // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
472:             // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
473:             if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
474:                 revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
475:             }
476:             _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
477:             emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
478:         }
479: 
480:         if (_amount > 0) {
481:             _fundPool(_amount, poolId, _strategy);
482:         }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider require `msg.value` to be exactly equal to the expected amount **Or** refund the user if there is remainder
