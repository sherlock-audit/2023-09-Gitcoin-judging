# RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol#_allocate()
The internal `_allocate` function inside `RFPCommitteStrategy` sets the `acceptedRecipientId` for that specific strategy. There is also a vote threshold that must be reached in order to set the recipient as accepted. The problem is that this function has a modifier `onlyPoolManager`, so only the pool manager can call this function and there is only one pool manager per strategy. If he sets the `voteThreshold`  to > 1 upon the strategy's initialization, then there can never be an accepted recipient, since only one address can call this function.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the `_allocate` function.

```javascript
    /// @notice Select recipient for RFP allocation
    /// @dev This is called by the pool manager. The recipient is accepted when the vote threshold is reached.
    ///      Emits `Allocated` event and `Voted` event.
    /// @param _data The data to be decoded
    /// @param _sender The sender of the allocation
    function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal override onlyPoolManager(_sender) {
        if (acceptedRecipientId != address(0)) {
            revert RECIPIENT_ALREADY_ACCEPTED();
        }

        // Check if the allocator has already casted the vote
        address voteCastedTo = votedFor[_sender];
        if (voteCastedTo != address(0)) {
            // remove the old vote to allow recasting of vote
            votes[voteCastedTo] -= 1;
        }

        // Decode the '_data'
        address recipientId = abi.decode(_data, (address));

        // Increment the votes for the recipient
        votes[recipientId] += 1;
        // Update the votedFor mapping
        votedFor[_sender] = recipientId;

        // Emit the event
        emit Voted(recipientId, _sender);

        // Check if the recipient has reached the vote threshold
        if (votes[recipientId] == voteThreshold) {
            // Set the accepted recipient
            acceptedRecipientId = recipientId;

            Recipient storage recipient = _recipients[acceptedRecipientId];
            recipient.recipientStatus = Status.Accepted;

            // Set the pool to inactive
            _setPoolActive(false);

            emit Allocated(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.proposalBid, allo.getPool(poolId).token, address(0));
        }
    }
```

We can see that only when a recipient has reached the `voteThreshold`, only then he becomes the accepted recipient. The problem, as stated above, is that if `voteThreshold` is > 1, this can never be reached, as only the pool manager can call this function and only he gets to cast a vote.

## Impact
The strategy will never have an accepted recipient and the strategy will never work correctly.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
One fix is to allow for everyone to call `_allocate` so they can cast their vote.
Another fix is to allow the pool manager to specify who is casting the vote and to whom they cast their vote. The pool manager can get this information off-chain or whatever other way the protocol team decides.
