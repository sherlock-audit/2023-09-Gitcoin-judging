# `_createPool()` Unexpectedly Reverts Despite Adequate Funds Supplied
## Summary
In cases where `baseFee` is set to true, the `_createPool()` function unexpectedly reverts even when sufficient funds are provided, resulting in unexpected failures.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's examine the `_createPool()` function, especially when the `baseFee` parameter is set to true. `baseFee` is paid in `NATIVE` token. The protocol expects the caller to provide the `baseFee` in addition to the `_amount`. This implies that if `baseFee + _amount > msg.value`, the function should revert. However, it currently reverts even when `baseFee + _amount = msg.value`. This issue also persists when a non-native `_token` is used.
```solidity
        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
```

## Impact
The issue arises when `baseFee + _amount` is equal to `msg.value`, causing the function to revert erroneously. This problem also occurs when a non-native _token is involved.

## Recommendation
```solidity
        if (baseFee > 0) {
-           if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
+           if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
```
