# Multiple Recipient can submit the same milestone and get paid
## Summary
This can actually happen, mainly because of two main things, let's explore both 

1.	The poolMangers who are to accept to pay a receiver for their submitted milestone 
2.	The fact that a milestone is not specifically directed to an accepted Recipient. 

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L253C5-L271C6

This means that any accepted Recipient can go on and submit a milestone in which other recipients submitted and get the profit or rewards for it.

This can manifest in different ways, a accepted recipient may not necessarily have the permission to participate in the completion of this milestone, but sensing an opportunity to get the profit can submit the same milestone other recipients did and get a payday, the second way this can happen is if all recipients have to submit and if the milestone was for the participants to complete some proof of work to actually get paid, other recipient can just not do anything and get paid. 

This may happen in part if the malicious recipients cleverly submit the milestones that represent the proof of work, over a period of time at some interval to send the same milestones others did.

## Impact

Funds meant for a set of acceptedRecipents can be collected by another recipient, while not actually doing anything to qualify them to receive those awards 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function submitUpcomingMilestone(Metadata calldata _metadata) external {
        // Check if the 'msg.sender' is the 'acceptedRecipientId' and is a member of the 'Profile'
        if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender && !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)) {
            revert UNAUTHORIZED();
        }

        // Check if the upcoming milestone is in fact upcoming
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

        // Get the milestone and update the metadata and status
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        milestone.metadata = _metadata;

        // Set the milestone status to 'Pending' to indicate that the milestone is submitted
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Pending;

        // Emit event for the milestone
        emit MilstoneSubmitted(upcomingMilestone);
    }
```
Here the metadata used to submit the milestone has no check if the same milestone has being used or submitted before, leaving that crucial check point to different pool managers, which defeats the purpose of an automated smart contract strategy, this can be capitalized upon by attackers masking as recipients.
## Tool used

Foundry, Hardhat

## Recommendation

A way I would address this is to maybe add a confirmation if the same particular milestone has not being submitted before, so has to neutralize attempts of submitting copy milestones from other recipients. 
A milestone not meant for every recipient, is actually not a good design system, if the strategy was meant to perform in this kind of way, i think the users of the strategy should actually be notified, this would mean that whenever someone wants to use this strategy it can only be used in a situation where every recipient has the same milestones to complete and a check used be used if the same milestone has being actually sent and accepted before.
