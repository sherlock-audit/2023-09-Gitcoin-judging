# `allocator.voiceCredits` not increased allowing allocators to allocate any amount

Due to no update to the voiceCredits of an allocator, any allocator may give any recipient any amount of votes.

## Vulnerability Detail

When allocating votes to a recipient in the `QVSimpleStrategy` contract, the `_allocate` function checks that the allocator has enough voice credits to allocate. Since the allocator's voiceCredits is not updated after allocating to the recipient, the allocator is able to continuosly allocate a maximum of `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`.

## Impact

An allocator can bypass `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`` and give recipient or many recipients any amount of votes.
