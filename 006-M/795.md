# Incorrect Check in `_distribute` Function in `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` Leads to Reversion of Valid Distributions
In the `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` contract, the `_distribute` function has an incorrect check that compares the recipient's proposal bid directly to the pool amount. This can lead to an incorrect revert condition and disrupt the distribution process.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is within the ` _distribute` function, specifically in the following code snippet:
```solidity
// make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
```
This code checks if the recipient's proposal bid is greater than the current pool amount and reverts if true.However according to this 
Scenario:
  1)  Initialize the `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` contract with the following parameters:
       ` poolAmount` (Total available funds in the pool) = 100e18
        `recipient.proposalBid` (Proposal bid submitted by the recipient) = 100
       ` milestones` = [50%,50%]
        Total number of milestones = 2

  2)  Perform the distribution of the first milestone:
        Calculate the distribution amount based on the proposal bid and milestone percentage: (100e18 * 50) / 1e18 = 50e18
        Subtract the calculated distribution amount from `poolAmount`: 100 - 50= 50

  3)  Attempt to distribute the second milestone:
        Now `poolAmount` = 50e18
        still `recipient.proposalBid` =100e18
        The incorrect check in the `_distribute function currently compares recipient.proposalBid to poolAmount directly, which is 100e18 > 50e18.
        Due to the incorrect check, the function will incorrectly revert with a "NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS" error.
## Impact
This can disrupt the distribution of funds for milestones and potentially prevent valid distributions.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {
        // check to make sure there is a pending milestone
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

        IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        Recipient memory recipient = _recipients[acceptedRecipientId];

        // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
        if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();

        // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
        uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;

        // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
        poolAmount -= amount;
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

        // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;

        // Increment the upcoming milestone
        upcomingMilestone++;

        // Emit events for the milestone and the distribution
        emit MilestoneStatusChanged(upcomingMilestone, Status.Accepted);
        emit Distributed(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
    }
   ```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
this should be checking `if ((recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18 > poolAmount)`
