# Remaining Native Token in Contract When Transferring BaseFee
## Summary
User's native token will remain in the contract, and it cannot be retrieved due to improper validation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_createPool()` function is used to create a new pool and pay a fee to the platform according to the `baseFee` state, sending it to the `treasury` address.

https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L415-L485

When the `_token` parameter is not the `NATIVE` state, the `msg.value` must be greater than the `baseFee` state in order to transfer it to the `treasury` address at line 476.

As a result, the contract will retain the native token as `msg.value - baseFee`.

## Impact
The native token of users will be left in the contract and cannot be retrieved.

## Tool used

Visual Studio Code / Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modifying to validate that `msg.value` is equal to `baseFee`.
