# `Allo.sol` feeAmount will round down to 0 when user calls `fundPool()` with small amount
## Summary

Allo wonâ€™t charge fee for fund small amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail

Allo.sol takes a fee when it funds a pool via `_fundPool()`, and the fee is applied based on the `percentFee`. The variable is represented in `e18` format as specified in the code.

> *How the percentage is represented in our contracts: 1e18 = 100%, 1e17 = 10%, 1e16 = 1%, 1e15 = 0.1%*
> 

So if Allo is, say, with 1e15 (0.1%), we need to pass at least 1000 as an amount in order for Allo to take a fee, any other numbers below that will round the calculation of fee Amount to 0.

No matter what `percentFee` is currently set. The amount when fund a pool, must be -

*`1e18 /* percentFee`*  or *`1e(18 - percentFee decimals)`*

## Impact

The user can call `fundPool()` with a small amount many times and Allo will never take any fees.

## Recommendation

Use other *`percentFee`* representation.
