# Function `_distribute` of `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` would be reverted due to the coding error.
## Summary
Function `_distribute` of `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` would be reverted due to the coding error.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_distribute` function of `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` is as follows.
```solidity
File: RFPSimpleStrategy.sol
414:     /// @notice Distribute the upcoming milestone to acceptedRecipientId.
415:     /// @dev '_sender' must be a pool manager to distribute.
416:     /// @param _sender The sender of the distribution
417:     function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
418:         internal
419:         virtual
420:         override
421:         onlyInactivePool
422:         onlyPoolManager(_sender)
423:     {
...
431:         // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
432:         if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
433: 
434:         // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
435:         uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;
436: 
437:         // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
438:         poolAmount -= amount;
...
450:     }
```
L432 is the validation check to make sure pool has enough funds for this milestone's distribution.
But the `poolAmount` is mistakenly compared against `recipient.proposalBid`, which is invalid parameter to compare.
L432 must compare `poolAmount` with L435's `amount`.
`poolAmount` is current funds of the pool. And this amount is getting decreased by every `_distribute` call.
Meanwhile, `recipient.proposalBid` is fixed value so L432's compare can be reverted after few `_distribute` calls.

## Impact
Pool's legitimate funds might fail to be distributed.
