# Recipients are given more votes than intended to
## Summary
When the QVBase strategy is used any recipient who is allocated votes would receive much more than the allocator intended to.
## Vulnerability Detail
In QVBaseStrategy.sol, the `_qv_allocate` function is responsible for allocating voice credits to a recipient. The issue is that whenever an allocator's `voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` is updated it is incremented by the `totalCredits` variable instead of the `_voiceCreditsToAllocate`. The `totalCredits` variable should be the total amount of credits an allocator has given to the recipient, whereas the `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` is the newly allocated voice credits. So whenever an allocator allocates votes to the same recipient more than one time, their entire `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` amount is again added to the `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient`, whereas only the newly allocated amount should be added.
Consequently, the `totalCredits`, used to derive the final vote result, would be inflated as it is equal to: 
`_voiceCreditsToAllocate +  _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];`
## Impact
The QVBaseStrategy vote calculations would be completely wrong and recipients would be given much more votes than they were allocated. This would give an unfair advantage to some recipients and allow allocators to maliciously increase their voting power.

```solidity
        uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
        uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId];

        // get the total credits and calculate the vote result
        uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
        uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);

        // update the values
        voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
        totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
        _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;

        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
        _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;

```

## Recommendation
Change `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;` to `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] = totalCredits;`.
