# In case if recipient's address is blocked by token, then he can't receive funds
## Summary
In case if recipient's address is blocked by token, then he can't receive funds
## Vulnerability Detail
In all pools user can provide address, were tokens should be sent after. User is generally able to change this address at any pool, but only for some period. For example for RFP pool, it's possible only when pool [is active](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L317), for QV pool only [when active registration](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L373) and [same for Donation pools](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L531).

When this period has ended, user can't change recipient address. As result in case if this address is blocked by token, then he will not be ablt to receive payment.
## Impact
User can't receive funds
