# Anyone can activate or de-activate an `RFPSimpleStrategy` pool
## Summary

[`setPoolActive()`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219) in `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` has no access controls and is marked `external`, which means anyone can call it.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external { // @audit - add a modifier here, or remove the function
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add access controls on `setPoolActive()`, or preferably, remove it completely, as even if the `onlyPoolManager` modifier is added it would give pool managers a high degree of power over the strategy.
