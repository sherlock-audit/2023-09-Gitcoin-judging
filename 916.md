# Non-profiled users can register as recipients in `RfpSimpleStrategy`
## Summary

When `useRegistryAnchor` is false non-profile users can bypass `_isProfileMember` check in `_registerRecipient` because of a wrong **logical operator** being used (&&).

## Vulnerability Detail

A user who is not either the admin or manager of a profile can register in a pool by bypassing the most important check in the `_registerRecipient` function. The attack is simple and is possible when `useRegistryAnchor` is false. The way it can be done is simple:  

1. Pool owner creates a pool with `useRegistryAnchor` = false, it cannot be changed in a later stage of the strategy.

```solidity
function __RFPSimpleStrategy_init(uint256 _poolId, InitializeParams memory _initializeParams) internal {
    // Initialize the BaseStrategy
    __BaseStrategy_init(_poolId);

    // Set the strategy specific variables
		//@audit that is the variable that we care for
    useRegistryAnchor = _initializeParams.useRegistryAnchor;
    metadataRequired = _initializeParams.metadataRequired;
    _registry = allo.getRegistry();
    _increaseMaxBid(_initializeParams.maxBid);

    // Set the pool to active - this is required for the strategy to work and distribute funds
    // NOTE: There may be some cases where you may want to not set this here, but will be strategy specific
    _setPoolActive(true);
}
```

1. Malicious user passes **address(0)** as an argument for `registryAnchor`. 
2. **isUsingRegistryAnchor** = false and **recipientId** = _sender aka. (msg.sender), and after that the ******if****** check at line 345, will pass without revert

```solidity
else {
    //  @custom:data when 'false' -> (address recipientAddress, address registryAnchor, uint256 proposalBid, Metadata metadata)
    (recipientAddress, registryAnchor, proposalBid, metadata) =
        abi.decode(_data, (address, address, uint256, Metadata));

    // Check if the registry anchor is valid so we know whether to use it or not
    isUsingRegistryAnchor = registryAnchor != address(0);

    // Ternerary to set the recipient id based on whether or not we are using the 'registryAnchor' or '_sender'
    recipientId = isUsingRegistryAnchor ? registryAnchor : _sender;

    // Checks if the '_sender' is a member of the profile 'anchor' being used and reverts if not
345:if (isUsingRegistryAnchor && !_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
}
```

## Impact

Possibility of spamming the contract and hitting the uint256 limit of **recipientIds** array.

### PoC

Insert the PoC in the `allo-v2/test/foundry/strategies/RFPSimpleStrategy.t.sol` contract in order to validate the issue.

Run: `forge test --match-test test_user_can_register_even_if_he_is_not_profile_member`

```solidity

function test_user_can_register_even_if_he_is_not_profile_member() public {
    address sender = recipient();
    Metadata memory metadata = Metadata({protocol: 1, pointer: "metadata"});

    //@audit just have to pass address(0) as registryAnchor, then this if will pass:
    //if (isUsingRegistryAnchor && !_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
    //becuase isUsingRegistryAnchor will be false and _isProfileMember won't be executed
    bytes memory data = abi.encode(recipientAddress(), address(0), 1e18, metadata);
    vm.prank(randomAddress());
    address registeredRecipient = allo().registerRecipient(poolId, data);
}
```

Manual Review, Foundry

## Recommendation

Consider authorizing users without using variables that can be manipulated by a user.
