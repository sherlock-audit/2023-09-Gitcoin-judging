# allocator.voiceCredits is never accumulated throughout the QVSimpleStrategy._allocate flow
## Summary

Each allocator has an [[Allocator](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L140-L146)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L140-L146) structure that records voting information, where `voiceCredits` is used to record allocated voice credits. However, `voiceCredits` will never be accumulated, which results in the allocator being able to ignore the limit of `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` and keep voting for a specific recipientId. In the end, the recipientId can take away far more payout than it could have received.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: contracts\strategies\qv-simple\QVSimpleStrategy.sol
107:     function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal virtual override {
108:         (address recipientId, uint256 voiceCreditsToAllocate) = abi.decode(_data, (address, uint256));
109: 
110:         // spin up the structs in storage for updating
111:         Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
112:         Allocator storage allocator = allocators[_sender];
...... 
120:         // check that the recipient has voice credits left to allocate
121:->       if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();
122:         
123:         _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
124:     }

144:     function _hasVoiceCreditsLeft(uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate, uint256 _allocatedVoiceCredits)
145:         internal
146:         view
147:         override
148:         returns (bool)
149:     {   //@audit _allocatedVoiceCredits = allocator.voiceCredits
150:->       return _voiceCreditsToAllocate + _allocatedVoiceCredits <= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator;
151:     }
```

The second parameter of `_hasVoiceCreditsLeft` is `allocator.voiceCredits`. This function is to check whether the allocator still has enough voiceCredits to allocate.

L123, [[_qv_allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L506-L534)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L506-L534) is called, where `allocator.voiceCredits` is not accumulated.

Since `allocator.voiceCredits` is always 0, the allocator can vote at will regardless of the limit of `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`.

Consider the following scenario:

For simplicity, there are two allocators (alice and bob), `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` is 100. There are two recipients (A and B).

1.  Alice votes for A with 100 VoiceCredits by calling `Allo.allocate`. After that, Alice thinks she has no VoiceCredit left. A got 10 votes (`sqrt(100) = 10`).
2.  bob votes for B with 100 VoiceCredits by calling `Allo.allocate`. He does this 100 times. After that, B got 100 votes (`sqrt(100 * 100) = 100`).
3.  The total number of votes is `100 + 10 = 110`.
4.  The pool manager calls `Allo.distribute` to distribute tokens for A and B. The amount of distributed tokens is calculated by [[_getPayout](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L571C22-L571C32)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L571C22-L571C32): `payoutA = poolAmount * (10/110) = poolAmount * 0.09`, `payoutB = poolAmount * (100/110) = poolAmount * 0.91`.

We can see that B got 91% of the funds, while A only got 9% of the funds.

## Impact

`Allocator.voiceCredits` is never accumulated, resulting in the following impacts:

1.  The allocator can vote for specific recipients without restrictions, seriously damaging the fairness of voting.
2.  The distribution of funds depends on the number of votes received by each recipient. The more votes received, the more funds will be distributed.
