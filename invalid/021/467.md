# Wrong check can prevent users from creating pool, or make them spend more than needed
## Summary
[_createPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L415-L485) has an issue with one of the [if statements](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L473-L475). Because of the current implementation of the check, if the user passes exact amount to pay the pool creation fee and the fund amount the call will revert. For it to not revert a user must send more native tokens that are required for the **base fee + fund amount**, effectively leaving the extra stuck in the contract, waiting for the Allo owner to rescue them. 

## Vulnerability Detail
With the current [if check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L473-L475) if a user sends exact amounts for fee + funding, the TX will revert, because the check uses `>=` instead of `>`. 

Example:

| *Prerequisites* | *Values* |
|-----------------|----------|
| Pool token      | ETH      |
| Base fee        | 0.1 ETH  |
| Fund amount     | 0.5 ETH  |

1. User knows the fee and how much he is needed to fund the pool.
2. He calls [_createPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L415-L485) with 0.6 ETH as `msg.value`
3. The TX is reverted because both `_token == NATIVE` and `baseFee + _amount >= msg.value` are true. Which trigger the first side of the [if statement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L473-L475), passing as true and then reverting with `NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS`, while the funds were enough for the operation.

## Impact
Function does not work properly, users are donating funds to the owner and  the owner needs to rescue funds

## Code Snippet
```solidity
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
```

## Recommendation
```diff
-           if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
+           if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
