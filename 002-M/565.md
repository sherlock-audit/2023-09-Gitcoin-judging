# Some tokens have a transfer fee, which leads to a discrepancy between the amount of tokens recorded in the strategy contract and the actual amount of tokens received
## Summary
Some tokens have a transfer fee, which leads to a discrepancy between the amount of tokens recorded in the strategy contract and the actual amount of tokens received.

## Vulnerability Detail
According to [this link](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer), some tokens have a transfer fee. In such cases, the  amount of received tokens is less than what the sender initially sent. Therefore, on line 517, the value of amountAfterFee cannot be used directly.

## Impact
The token amount recorded in the strategy contract may be greater than the actual amount received.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Record the amounts of tokens in the strategy contract both before and after sending tokens to the strategy contract. The difference between these two amounts is the actual amount of tokens received by the strategy contract
