There is no check if the milestone is rejected in _distribute in `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol`
## Vulnerability Detail
If the milestone is rejected the distribute function will still transfer the money for the milestone that is upcoming and will set it status to Accepted
## Impact
All of the milestones will be accepted even if they are rejected by the manager of the pool.
