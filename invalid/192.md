# `Allo` and `Registry` use `AccessControl` without storage gaps which can break storage layout on upgrade

Both `Allo` and `Registry` are upgradable contracts accessed the a TransparentProxy.
When using an OZ proxy its important that all inherited contracts have storage gaps so they can be updated without causing storage layout issues

## Vulnerability Detail
`Allo`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L38
```solidity
---------
import "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";
import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol";
---------
contract Allo is IAllo, Native, Transfer, Initializable, Ownable, AccessControl, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, Errors {
```

`Registry`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L40C14-L40C14
```solidity
---------
import {AccessControl} from "openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/access/AccessControl.sol";
import "openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol";
---------
contract Registry is IRegistry, Native, AccessControl, Transfer, Initializable, Errors {
```

As can be seen - both contracts use the non-upgradable `AccessControl.sol`which does not have storage gaps.
Any future update in `AccessControl` storage will corrupt the contract storage layout and override used slots.

## Impact

Potential storage corruption.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the `AccessControl` that is upgradable through `openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable` contracts.
