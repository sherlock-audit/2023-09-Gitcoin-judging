# Multiple allocations to the same recipient by the same allocator will heavily inflate their received votes in `QV` strategies
Excessive increase to `voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` in `_qv_allocate` will heavily inflate received votes for a recipient in subsequent allocations made by the same allocator.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_qv_allocate`, `totalCredits` refers to the total credits the allocator will have allocated to the recipient after the transaction finishes. `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` is *increased* by `totalCredits` rather than set to it, double counting the voice credits already allocated to the recipient beforehand.

```solidity
        uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
        uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId];

        // get the total credits and calculate the vote result
        uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
        uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);

        // update the values
        voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
        totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
        _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;

        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
        _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;
```
This means repeated allocations to the same recipient will heavily inflate `voiceCreditsCastToRecipient`. Since `voteResult` is calculated based on `totalCredits` which includes the stored `voiceCreditsCastToRecipient`, the `totalVotesReceived` for the recipient will also be heavily inflated. 

## Impact
Inflated `totalVotesReceived`  for multiple allocations to the same recipient by the same allocator allowing exploiters to artificially inflate specific recipients' total share of votes, and consequently the share of funding received by those recipients.

## Recommendation
Consider only increasing `voiceCreditsCaseToRecipient` by `_voiceCreditsToAllocate`.
