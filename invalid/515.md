# Missing validation that pool token is a valid contract

Lack of validation that a pool's token is a valid contract can lead to all token transfer functions succeeding, resulting in excessive spent gas or giving an attacker the ability to trick users into doing work.

## Vulnerability Detail

Pool creation logic allows for any address to be used as the pool token, without any validation that the token is in fact a deployed contract. All transfer logic used throughout the protocol (both via Transfer.sol and Permit2) uses low level calls to execute token transfers. Low level calls always succeed if the address being called doesn't contain any code, so all execution will proceed as expected, even with cloneable strategies. 

Consider for example how this might be manipulable by an attacker:
- Attacker creates a pool with cloneable strategy (cloneable implies expected functionality)
  - Attacker sets pool token as a well known token address, e.g. WETH, but changes one character for a similar looking one
- Users interact with the pool assuming that it is the correct address
  - All accounting state is as expected, e.g. getPoolAmount returns an amount as if it's been funded, so it's reasonable to fall for this
- Attacker convinces users to contribute milestones to receive compensation
- In the end, the attacker received free work and the user receives no tokens even though all contract state had reasonably suggested that they would be compensated as expected

## Impact

Attackers can convince users of invalid contract state, e.g. contract balance, to trick users into doing work.

```solidity
// @audit comment from solady safeTransferLib (used by Transfer.sol)
/// - For ERC20s, this implementation won't check that a token has code,
///   responsibility is delegated to the caller.
```

```solidity
// @audit comment from solmate safeTransferLib (used by Permit2)
/// @dev Note that none of the functions in this library check that a token has code at all! That responsibility is delegated to the caller.
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include logic in `Allo._createPool` to validate that the pool token being used is a contract, e.g.:

```solidity
if (_token.code.length == 0) revert INVALID_TOKEN();
```
