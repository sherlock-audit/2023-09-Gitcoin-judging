# Funds might be stuck in a strategy contract
## Summary

In the case where pool is funded directly, these funds can't be withdrawn and are permanently locked in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The example is taken from RFPSimpleStrategy contract, but the issue is relevant for all strategies.

If `_amount` to withdraw is greater than `poolAmount` function call will fail due to underflow. The `poolAmount` value  increases only when pool is funded using the Allo protocol. If pool is funded directly `poolAmount` will always be less than the actual balance, and difference will stuck in the contract.

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) onlyInactivePool {
    // Decrement the pool amount
    poolAmount -= _amount;

    // Transfer the amount to the pool manager
    _transferAmount(allo.getPool(poolId).token, msg.sender, _amount);
}
```

## Impact

I know that direct funding is not the expected use case of the Allo protocol.

Moreover, the Allo protocol is protected from these cases. For example, the RFPSimpleStrategy can't be used with direct funding, since the `_distribute` function also checks `poolAmount` and funds can't be distributed.

```solidity
if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
```

However, if funds somehow get into a strategy contract other than using the Allo protocol, it will be impossible to recover them. This can easily happen by mistake or from a non-obvious frontend implementation. Especially if strategy uses the native token, user may find it easier to simply send funds to the pool address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

First of all, you can allow withdrawing `_amount` greater than `poolAmount`. In this case, the Allo protocol will still be protected from unexpected usage, but it will be possible to recover funds sent directly. Also as for now manager can withdraw funds only to their own address, seems a good idea to allow providing a recipient address.

```solidity
function withdraw(address _recipient, uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) onlyInactivePool {
    // Decrement the pool amount
    poolAmount = _amount > poolAmount ? 0 : poolAmount - _amount;

    // Transfer the amount to the pool manager
    _transferAmount(allo.getPool(poolId).token, _recipient, _amount);
}
```

Additionally, you can add a function to withdraw any token, and make it a part of BaseStrategy contract as default implementation.

```solidity
function withdraw(address _token, address _recipient, uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
    address poolToken = allo.getPool(poolId).token;
    
    if _token == poolToken {
        _withdraw(_recipient, _amount);
    } else {
        // Get the amount of the token to transfer, which is always the entire balance of the contract address
        uint256 amount = _token == NATIVE ? address(this).balance : IERC20Upgradeable(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
        
        // Transfer the amount to the recipient (pool owner)
        _transferAmount(_token, _recipient, amount);
    }
}

function withdraw(address _recipient, uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
    _withdraw(_recipient, _amount);
}

function _withdraw(address _recipient, uint256 _amount) internal onlyInactivePool {
    // Decrement the pool amount
    poolAmount = _amount > poolAmount ? 0 : poolAmount - _amount;

    // Transfer the amount to the pool manager
    _transferAmount(allo.getPool(poolId).token, _recipient, _amount);
}
```
