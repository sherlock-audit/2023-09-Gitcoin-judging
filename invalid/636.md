# when funding the pool there can be a zero transfer of fee value
## Summary

When calculating the possible fee if the token has less the 18 decimals or fee is set too low the calculated fee value can be zero.
This can potentially revert if used with a token that doesn't permit zero value transfer. 

## Vulnerability Detail

After the calculation on this line

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L510

before transfering the fee there is no check that the `feeAmount` is bigger then zero. If the `feePercent` is less then 10^12


## Impact

If the used token is UDSC that has 6 decimals and the used value is low if `feePercent` is little less then 10^18 we get a 0 for the `feeAmount`

If used with a [zero transfer token](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#revert-on-zero-value-transfers) in case of a zero fee this will also revert.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check for a zero `feeAmount` before doing the transfer

```diff
if (percentFee > 0) {
    feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
    amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;
+
+   if (feeAmount > 0) {
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
+   }    
}
```
