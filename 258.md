# In RFPCommitteeStrategy, acceptedRecipient may flop between multiple recipients, causing the wrong person to be paid for a milestone
## Summary

`RFPCommitteeStrategy._allocate` does not check if the pool is active or if someone else has already been selected. Therefore, the acceptedRecipient may switch between multiple people. Even under honest behavior from pool admins, problems can occur that, for example, lead to people being paid for work they didn't do.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. An RFPCommitteeStrategy pool is funded and created. There are 6 managers, including Alice and Bob. voteThreshold is set to 3.
2. Two people, Carol and Dan, both submit proposals. As part of it, Carol also submits a lot of detail for the first part of the project, equivalent to the first milestone
3. Carol and Dan each get 2 votes from the 4 unnamed managers
4. Alice calls allo.allocate to cast her vote for Carol. Knowing that Carol has already submitted work good for the first milestone, she also immediately calls distribute(). (Note that distribution does not require a prior call to `submitUpcomingMilestone()`.)
5. At about the same time, Bob calls allo.allocate() to cast his vote for Dan. He does not call distribute(), as Dan has not submitted the work yet.
6. The transactions get ordered in the following way: `allo.allocate(Carol); allo.allocate(Dan); allo.distribute()`.
7. The first call to allo.allocate  pushes Carol past the vote threshold. `acceptedRecipient` is set to Carol. `poolActive` is set to false.
8. Even though a recipient has already been chosen, the second call to allo.allocate runs as if no-one has been chosen. The call pushes Dan past the vote threshold and assigns `acceptedRecipient` to Dan.
9. Dan gets paid despite not having done the work

## Impact

Even with honest admins who never try to call allocate() when the pool closes, the wrong person may get paid.

## Code Snippet

Notice the lack of an `onlyActivePool` guard on RFPCommitteeStrategy._allocate: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-committee/RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol#L102

In contrast, `RFPSimpleStrategy._allocate` has one:  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L391

Subsequent calls to _allocate will thus clobber the first. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-committee/RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol#L126-L136

## Recommendation

Mark RFPCommitteStrategy.allocate() as `onlyActivePool`
