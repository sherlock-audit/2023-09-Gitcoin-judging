# Function `_fundPool` of `Allo.sol` does not return the remained eth to the user.
Function `_fundPool` of `Allo.sol` does not return the remained eth to the user at the end.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function `_fundPool` of `Allo.sol` is called by function `_createPool` and transfer only `amountAfterFee = amount - feeAmount` to strategy.
In case of ERC20 token, there will be no problem at all. But in case of eth, function should return the remained eth to the user.
It a user send more `amount` mistakenly, there will be remained eth by `msg.value - baseFee - amount` and it will not be returned to user.

## Impact
Users can lose eth by mistakes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Return the remained eth to user by insert the following code at the bottom of function `_fundPool`.

    }
```
