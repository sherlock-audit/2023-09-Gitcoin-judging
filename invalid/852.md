# Not using the upgradable variant of access control in upgradable contracts at multiple places.
While writing the upgradable contracts, unlike solady there are separate contracts to support upgradibility in openzeppelin libraries, but the project is using the non upgradable variant.
## Vulnerability Detail
Openzeppelin provides the up-gradable variant of standard contracts, if those are not used the whole upgrade-abilitiy thing for the contract be bricked and it would not be fully upgradeable.

Solady have by default support for upgrades in each contract, while openzeppelin have done those separately.

Use the AccessControlUpgrdable at following places:

Allo.sol
```solidity
contract Allo is IAllo, Native, Transfer, Initializable, Ownable, AccessControl, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, Errors {
```

Registery.sol

```solidity
contract Registry is IRegistry, Native, AccessControl, Transfer, Initializable, Errors {
```

## Impact
Smart contracts will not be upgradable
