# [H-03] Missing access control in `RFPSimpleStrategy::setPoolActive()` can cause a lot of issues.
## Summary

Missing access control in `RFPSimpleStrategy::setPoolActive()` can cause a lot of issues and make the pools using this strategy vulnerable to many attacks and render it unusable.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [RFPSimpleStrategy::setPoolActive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L216C5-L223C1) is meant to be called only by the `poolManager` (Even explicitly mentioned on the comments). Which is not implemented and can cause many issues by toggling the status of pool by a malicious actor.

## Impact

[RFPSimpleStrategy::setPoolActive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L216C5-L223C1) can be spammed by a malicious actor by toggling the `poolStatus` and cause issues on pools using this strategy such as ðŸ‘‡ 

1. When the [withdraw()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L295C3-L301C6) is called by the Pool Manager which can be only done when the pool is not active, a malicious actor can always frontrun and toggle the pool status to `active` causing withdraw impossible.
2. Can toggle `poolStatus` to false to make [_allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L386C2-L412C6) impossible.
3. Similarly, can toggle `poolStatus` to True to make [_distribute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L417C4-L450C6) impossible.
4. Another interesting one is that, for pools allowing anyone to register recipient, malicious actor can make the poolStatus active and call [_registerRecipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L314C5-L381C1) with data of recipients whose `status == accepted`. This causes the status of recipient to become Pending, which will strip of their allocation. This is not that likely as sender needs to be profile member, they can accidentally call the function or if profile member is not trusted, then likelihood goes up. This is regarding this specific(#4) scenario.

All the first 3 scenarios has high likelihood and impact.

## Code Snippet

No access control in [setPoolActive()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L216C2-L222C6) even when it is explicitly mentioned in the comments.

```javascript
 /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add access control  to the `setPoolStatus` function:

```javascript

    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
