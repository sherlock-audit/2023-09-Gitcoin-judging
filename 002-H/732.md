# function 'setPoolActive' does not have access control in contract 'RFPSimpleStrategy.sol'
## Summary
function _**setPoolActive**_ toggles the status of the pool between active and inactive. This function should be restricted to the pool manager. 

## Vulnerability Detail
function _**setPoolActive**_ can be invoked by anyone hence changing the status of the pool from active to inactive and vice versa.

## Impact
Any function with the modifier _**onlyActivePool**_ or _**onlyInactivePool**_ could be accessed/denied access by changing the status.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add _**onlyPoolManager**_ modifier to the function.
