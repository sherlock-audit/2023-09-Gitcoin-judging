# Funds are stuck because of missing subtraction
In the QV strategy poolAmount is not decreased after distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the [**distribute** function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L436-L465), the **poolAmount** is not decreased after distribution. This leads to wrong accounting. Imagine the following scenario:

1. Pool is funded with 400 tokens.
2. Funds get distributed, but poolAmount is left 400, not 0.
3. Pool gets funded with 300 tokens more, poolAmount becomes 700.
4. A new distribution is scheduled between two recipients with shares 20% and 80%.
5. The first recipient should get 60 (20% of 300) tokens, but now he will receive 140 (20% of 700).
6. Now there are not enough funds for the second recipient and the whole transaction will revert.
7. The funds are stuck in the contract.

The fact that the contract allows [updating](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L295-L302) the allocation and registration timestamps means that it is possible for a manager that does not know about this bug to try to distribute a second time.

## Impact
Loss of funds.

## Code Snippet
```jsx
    function _distribute(address[] memory _recipientIds, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
        onlyAfterAllocation
    {
        uint256 payoutLength = _recipientIds.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < payoutLength;) {
            address recipientId = _recipientIds[i];
            Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];

            PayoutSummary memory payout = _getPayout(recipientId, "");
            uint256 amount = payout.amount;

            if (paidOut[recipientId] || !_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId) || amount == 0) {
                revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
            }

            IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
            _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

            paidOut[recipientId] = true;

            emit Distributed(recipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before the distribution starts, create a variable that will keep track of how many tokens will be distributed. 
```jsx
uint256 distributedTokens;
```

Update the variable for each recipient.

```jsx
distributedTokens += amount;
```

After the loop deduct it from the **poolAmount**,

```jsx
poolAmount -= distributedTokens;
```
