# Contract Reoccupation Risk with `CREATE3`
The use of CREATE3 to deploy contracts introduces a potential risk of contract reoccupation when a contract is destroyed via self-destruct (`selfdestruct`). This risk arises because the bytecode is deleted, allowing an attacker to potentially recreate a new contract at the same address using CREATE3. This issue can impact the security and intended functionality of contracts.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is related to the `_generateAnchor` function in the contract. When a contract is destroyed via `selfdestruct`, its bytecode is deleted, and the code size is set to zero. However, CREATE3 allows for the deterministic generation of contract addresses based on parameters such as `_profileId` and a `salt` value. If an attacker knows the same `_profileId`, `salt`, and the `preCalculatedAddress` of a previously deployed contract (that was subsequently destroyed), they can potentially recreate a new contract at the same address.
**Exploitation of Contract Reoccupation Vulnerability**:
1. Initial Contract Deployment:
- An attacker identifies a target contract that uses the CREATE3 opcode for contract deployment, such as the `_generateAnchor` function mentioned earlier.
2. Contract Destruction via Self-Destruct:
- The attacker waits for the target contract to be destroyed via self-destruct (`selfdestruct`). When a contract is self-destructed, its bytecode is deleted, and the code size is set to zero.
3. Collecting Information:
- The attacker gains knowledge of the parameters used for contract deployment, especially the `_profileId` and any salt value employed in the CREATE3 function.
4. Recreation of the Contract:
- Armed with the same `_profileId` and `salt` used previously, the attacker uses CREATE3 to redeploy a new contract to the same address that was occupied by the destroyed contract. This is possible because CREATE3 allows for the deterministic calculation of contract addresses based on parameters.
5. Exploitation:
- The attacker's recreated contract now occupies the same address as the previously destroyed contract. Depending on the context and functionality of the contract, this can lead to various forms of exploitation:
i) Unauthorized access: The attacker may gain control over contract resources or assets intended for the destroyed contract.
ii) Inconsistent state: The attacker may interfere with the intended functionality of the contract, causing unexpected behavior or erroneous state changes.
iii) Security breaches: If the destroyed contract had security-sensitive logic, the attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the contract's logic.
## Impact
The consequences of this exploitation can vary widely depending on the specific contract's purpose and functionality. They may include financial losses, data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, or other forms of disruption.
