# Incompatibility With Fee-On-Transfer Tokens
The protocol is incompatible with Fee-On-Transfer tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
If fee-on-transfer tokens are used to fund a pool, there will be a difference between the actual amount in the pool and the amount in the accounting, the pool will account for a larger amount than it actually has.

At a later time, if we try to `withdraw()` or `distribute()` the full amount, it will revert since there are actually not that many tokens in the strategy as what the accounting says there are.
## Impact
Accounting shows more than actual balance of strategy. The `TREASURY` also receives less fee.
## Code Snippet
```javascript
function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));

        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Add logic to `transfer/transferFrom` to calculate exactly how many tokens were actually sent to a pool strategy address.
