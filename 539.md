# Pool deployer has to send more ETH than required to create a pool, while the surplus ether sent is most likely not returned to them , resulting permanent loss of funds
## Summary
When a user creates a pool through `createPool()` in Allo.sol with `baseFee`, they will always have to send more native token (e.g.ETH) than required to pay for fees. However, the surplus ether is most likely lost to them permanently but harvested by someone else.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the fact that `_createPool()` in Allo.sol enforces an over-restrictive check on `msg.value` will force users to overspend on the native token to pay for `baseFee`. In addition, there is no return of the enforced surplus ether later in the function. This results in surplus ether left in the pool whenever a pool has `baseFee` enabled.

```solidity
//Allo.sol
    function _createPool(
        bytes32 _profileId,
        IStrategy _strategy,
        bytes memory _initStrategyData,
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        Metadata memory _metadata,
        address[] memory _managers
    ) internal returns (uint256 poolId) {
...
        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
|>          if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
...
```
As seen above, the `if` and `revert` statement will ensure that when a user send just enough native token (`baseFee==msg.value` or `baseFee+_amount==msg.value` ), the transaction will always revert. To reconcile, users will always have to overspend and have surplus ether trapped in the pool.

Even though, Allo.sol does have a fund recovery method `recoverFunds()`, this won't help either for two reasons: (1) `recoverFunds()` is separate from the `createPool` flow and can only be called by allo owner. This means that `recoverFunds()` is not going to be called as frequently as needed to recover every single user's surplus ether; (2) `recoverFunds()` will send the total balance of a given token to one person. This means the cumulative surplus ether from all the users over time will eventually go to a single beneficiary instead of individual users. 

```solidity
//Allo.sol
    function recoverFunds(address _token, address _recipient) external onlyOwner {
        // Get the amount of the token to transfer, which is always the entire balance of the contract address
        uint256 amount = _token == NATIVE ? address(this).balance : IERC20Upgradeable(_token).balanceOf(address(this));

        // Transfer the amount to the recipient (pool owner)
        _transferAmount(_token, _recipient, amount);
```
## Impact
User will be forced to send surplus ether in order to create a pool, and their surplus ether will most likely not return to them, resulting in permanent loss of funds.

I consider this a medium severity due to material loss of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the `if` statement condition into `(_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)` Or return any surplus ether at the end of the `_createPool`.
