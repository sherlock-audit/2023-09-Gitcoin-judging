# When creating a pool in `Allo.sol` one must always send more native token than required for the baseFee
## Summary

When crating a pool one must send more native token than required for the base fee. The access native token send is not refunded and stay in the allo contract


## Vulnerability Detail

When creating a new pool, the pool creator must pay a baseFee in the native token of the chain. The problem is that code that checks if the amount sent as msg.value is enough to pay the baseFee is wrong. It reverts if msg.value is smaller or quale to the baseFee: 

```Solidity
 if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) { 
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
``` 

This means that one must send more native tokens than the baseFee and the access native tokens are not refunded to the user.


## Impact

User needs to pay more than the base fee to create a pool and the access amount of native tokens is not reverted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change `>=` to `>` two times.

Change this:

` if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) `

to this:

` if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value))`
