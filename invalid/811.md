# An attacker can change the minimum number of votes required to accept a recipient
## Summary
In RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol, the voteThreshold parameter contains the minimum number of votes required to accept the recipient. This parameter is set when calling the initialize() function. However, any user can subsequently call the initialize() function with its own input parameters:

## Vulnerability Detail
This will result in an attacker being able to set the minimum voteThreshold value and influence the acceptance of unwanted recipients.

## Impact
initialize() is of type external and is not protected by modifiers.
