# `Allo.initialize` is prone to front run attack which can lead to DOS
`Allo.initialize` is prone to front run attack which can lead to DOS

## Vulnerability Detail
As current implantation an after deploying the Allo contract any Attacker call initialize function with different any custom strategy  and with random baseFee and percent fee making overall deployment fail in a way.
Same goes whenever Allo will go for upgrade same front issue can stop Allo in upgrade.
```solidity
File: contracts/core/Allo.sol

    function initialize(address _registry, address payable _treasury, uint256 _percentFee, uint256 _baseFee)
        external
        reinitializer(1)
    {
        // Initialize the owner using Solady ownable library
        _initializeOwner(msg.sender);

        // Set the address of the registry
        _updateRegistry(_registry);

        // Set the address of the treasury
        _updateTreasury(_treasury);

        // Set the fee percentage
        _updatePercentFee(_percentFee);

        // Set the base fee
        _updateBaseFee(_baseFee);
    }

Attacker can front run this function just after the deployment making DOS. 
impact- HIGH
likelihood- Medium
As attacker should have good resources and but attack doesn't require any money/fee from Attacker so if Attackers are miners they can damage effectively 

## Impact

DOS

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Something like a access control can help to mitigate this issue.
A simple solution can be add `if(msg.sender != deployer) revert ERROR()`
but there can be better solution
