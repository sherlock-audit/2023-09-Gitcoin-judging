# percentFee can be bypassed in fundPool function in case of NATIVE token
## Summary
In case of native ETH pools  call to `fundPool` will succeed even if the pool owner didn't sent `feeAmount`.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. In `fundPool` function of `Allo` there are no checks to make sure that the caller sent enough ether which covers both `feeAmount` and `amountAfterFee` in case of native ETH.

Consider below example:
1. Bob wants to add 10 ether to the pool.
3. percentFee is 20%.
4. so Bob calls `fundPool` function passing `10 ether` as amount parameter but only passes 8 ether.
5. As fee is 20% `transferAmountFrom` is called with 2 ether when sending eth to treasury as 
      `msg.value(8 ether) >= 2 ether` check will pass.
6. And `transferAmountFrom` will be called with `8 ether(80%)` when transferring funds to strategy and check in `transferAmountFrom` will also pass here because `msg.value(8 ether) >= 8 ether`.

## Impact
`percentFee` can be bypassed in case of native ETH  as `percentFee`  will be paid from allo eth balance .
