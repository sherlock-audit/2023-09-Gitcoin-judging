# Anchor would not be able to hold soulbound NFTs as expected
## Summary

Anchor would not be able to hold soul-bound NFTs as expected

## Vulnerability Detail

Project documentation states that one of the possible uses of the `Anchor` contract is to act as a holder of soul-bounded tokens - https://docs.allo.gitcoin.co/project-registry/anchors#anchors

Most of the soul-bound tokens are extensions of the ERC721 or ERC1155, for example [ERC5633](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5633) or [ERC5484](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5484).

However, the `Anchor` contract lacks the implementation of the `onERC721Received()` and `onERC1155Received()` functions, which means that it would not be able to receive such tokens.

## Impact

Anchor would not be able to hold soul-bound NFTs as expected.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding `onERC721Received()` and `onERC1155Received()` functions to the `Anchor` contract.
