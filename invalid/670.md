# Transfer lib _transferAmount does not account for alternate native token representations

The transfer lib when attempting to transfer an amount which could be ETH but is not NATIVE does not revert which may lead to accounting errors.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol makes use of the `Transfer.sol` library which assists when making token transfers whether that be a native token such as ETH or an ERC20 token. The `_transferAmount` looks like the following:

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer an amount of a token to an address
/// @param _token The token to transfer
/// @param _to The address to transfer to
/// @param _amount The amount to transfer
function _transferAmount(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
    if (_token == NATIVE) {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_to, _amount);
    } else {
        SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, _to, _amount);
    }
}
```

 The function outlined above will first check for the NATIVE token which is hardcoded to `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE` . In some cases ETH is represented by `address(0)` when using native tokens however, the function attempts to send ERC20 tokens and May fail when attempting to do so.

## Impact

Should any other representation of a native token be used except for the hardcoded value in NATIVE, accounting errors may be incurred in some of the strategies deployed which may lead to more severe breakages.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Itâ€™s recommended that the function is refactored to look similarly to the following so that all representations of native are accounted for:

```solidity
function _transferAmount(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
				if (_token == NATIVE || _token == address(0)) {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_to, _amount);
        } else {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, _to, _amount);
        }
}
```
