# Lack of `disableinitializers` call to prevent uninitialized contracts
Lack of `disableinitializers` call to prevent uninitialized contracts

## Vulnerability Detail
Multiple contracts are using the Initializable module from OpenZeppelin. For this reason and in order to prevent leaving that contract uninitialized OpenZeppelin's documentation recommends adding the _disableInitializers function in the constructor to automatically lock the contracts when they are deployed. this will protect the contract that holds the logic business from being initialized by an attack.

```solidity

contract Allo is IAllo, Native, Transfer, Initializable, Ownable, AccessControl, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, Errors {

    /// @notice Percentage that is used to calculate the fee Allo takes from each pool when funded
    ///         and is deducted when a pool is funded. So if you want to fund a round with 1000 DAI and the fee
    ///         percentage is 1e17 (10%), then 100 DAI will be deducted from the 1000 DAI and the pool will be
    ///         funded with 900 DAI. The fee is then sent to the treasury address.
    /// @dev How the percentage is represented in our contracts: 1e18 = 100%, 1e17 = 10%, 1e16 = 1%, 1e15 = 0.1%

    /// @notice Fee Allo charges for all pools on creation
    /// @dev This is different from the 'percentFee' in that this is a flat fee and not a percentage. So if you want to create a pool
    ///      with a base fee of 100 DAI, then you would pass 100 DAI to the 'createPool()' function and the pool would be created
    ///      with 100 DAI less than the amount you passed to the function. The base fee is sent to the treasury address.
    uint256 internal baseFee;
