# The QV strategy does not accept ether
## Summary

`QVBaseStrategy.sol` is missing a receive() function so the QV strategies wont be able to receive ether and wont work. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The quadratic voting strategies are supposed to receive ether however `QVBaseStrategy.sol` is missing a `receive()` function so strategies like `QVSimpleStrategy` wont be able to receive ether and wont work. 

The user can unknowingly create a pool that accepts ether and uses the QVSimpleStrategy but because the contract doesnt accept ether all the calls will revert when other people will be donating. If the user wants to receive anything then he will have to create a new pool that uses a token.

## Impact

The QV Strategy will not work with ether and the user who created the pool will lose his funds because he payed for the fee and will have to pay again if he wants to create a working pool otherwise he will fail to get funding.

## Code Snippet

To test this you can add this function to `QVSimpleStrategy.t.sol` and as you will see it will fail. 

```solidity
function testRevert_sendEther() public {
     vm.startPrank(pool_manager1());
     vm.deal(pool_manager1(), 1 ether);
     (bool success, ) = address(qvSimpleStrategy()).call{value: 1 wei}("");
     require(success, "Ether transfer failed");
}

```

## Recommendation


Add a `receive()` function to `QVBaseStrategy` so it can receive ether.
