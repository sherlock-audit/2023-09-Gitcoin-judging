# Centralization Concerns in Admin-Controlled Merkle Root Distribution

Centralization Risk in **updateDistribution** Due to Admin-Controlled Merkle Root Updates

## Vulnerability Detail

The **updateDistribution** function allows an admin, or pool manager, to set the Merkle root and associated distribution metadata. While this provides flexibility in updating distribution details before it starts, it also poses a potential centralization risk. If the admin mistakenly misses out on a recipient or deliberately excludes one when forming the Merkle tree, that recipient would be unable to claim their funds. The function heavily relies on the correctness and integrity of the admin.

## Impact

This centralization risk can undermine trust in the system, as users might worry about the fairness and accuracy of the distribution. In a worst-case scenario, an unethical or compromised admin could manipulate distributions to their advantage or to disadvantage certain users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Instead of just setting a new Merkle root, the function can be modified to take an array of recipient details and then generate and verify the Merkle root in the contract itself. This way, users can see all the recipients and verify the integrity of the Merkle tree.
