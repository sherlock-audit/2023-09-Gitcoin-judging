# For the `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` the calling the function `withdraw` will always revert
When calling `withdraw` in the `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy`, the amount that is supposed to be withdraws is deducted from the variable `poolAmount`. Since the variable `poolAmount` is always zero because the `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` is funded by calling `Allo.allocate()` and not `Allo.fundPool()`, all calls to withdraw will revert and the tokens will be stuck in the contract for ever.


## Vulnerability Detail

If a pool manager wants to withdraw tokens that are stranded in the `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` he calls `withdraw`. This function takes an amount as a parameter and checks if the amount is bigger than the value of the `poolAmound`. If the pool manager wants to withdraw more than the `poolAmound`, the function reverts. The problem is that the `poolAmound` will always be 0 since funding the `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` by allocating funds to recipients does not increase the `poolAmound` but it increased the claimable amount for the recipient. This results in the function `withdraw()` always reverting since any amount a pool manager wants to withdraw will be bigger than 0.


## Impact

Calling `withdraw` will always revert and thereby preventing the pool manager from withdrawing stuck tokens. The tokens will be stuck in the contract for ever.
