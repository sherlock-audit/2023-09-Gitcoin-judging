# User can avoid having to pay fees when fund a pool
User can split fund into smaller amount to avoid having to pay fees when fund a pool
## Vulnerability Detail
When a pool is created and someone want to fund it, they can call  [`fundPool(uint256 _poolId, uint256 _amount)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L339C5-L345C6) to deposit into the pool, and pool has a fee collection mechanism when user fund pool : `feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator()`. However, user can split fund and call `fundPool` multiple time with smaller amount. When a small enough amount and percentFee lead to `(_amount * percentFee)` small than `getFeeDenominator()` -> feeAmount will become 0.
## Impact
Pool will lost the fee from user funding as intended
## Code Snippet
[fundPool](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L339C5-L345C6)
```solidity
    function fundPool(uint256 _poolId, uint256 _amount) external payable nonReentrant {
        // if amount is 0, revert with 'NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS()' error
        if (_amount == 0) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();


        // Call the internal fundPool() function
        _fundPool(_amount, _poolId, pools[_poolId].strategy);
    }
```
```solidity
    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;


        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;


        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;


            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }


        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);


        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set a require for smallest amount user can fund that suitable with percentFee of pool, so this problem will not happen
