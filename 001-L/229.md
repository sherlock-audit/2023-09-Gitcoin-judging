# Incorrect check in `_createPool()` leaves unused `NATIVE` on `Allo.sol`
## Summary

In the [`_createPool()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L473) function there is a check to make sure the `msg.value` is higher than the `baseFee` but this check is incorrect and requires the user to send at least 1 extra `wei` to the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a user wants to create a new pool they have to pay a `baseFee` to Gitcoin. This fee is taken in the function [`_createPool()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L473).

The fee is paid in `NATIVE` token so to make sure enough fund where send, there is a check on `msg.value` amount.

But this check is wrong as it requires `msg.value` to be higher than `baseFee` or `baseFee + amount` thus users will have to send at least one extra `wei` that won't be used.

## Impact

Medium, loss is very small but still annoying and constant.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
  revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `>` instead of `>=` in the `if`.

```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
  revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
}
```
