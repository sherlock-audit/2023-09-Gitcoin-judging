# QVSimpleStrategy, RFPSimpleStrategy, and RFPCommitteeStrategy's `allocate()` function does not prohibit receiving NATIVE tokens nor does it record the accounting when receiving NATIVE tokens.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

Additionally, `QVBaseStrategy.sol` does not have a withdrawal method, which causes the NATIVE tokens received through `allocate()` to be locked in the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider requiring `msg.value == 0` in `_beforeAllocate()` of these strategies.

```solidity
function _beforeAllocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal virtual {
    if (msg.value > 0) {
        revert INVALID();
    }
}
```
