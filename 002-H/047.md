# setPoolActive()  lacks access control
## Summary
setPoolActive()  lacks access control
## Vulnerability Detail
In RFPSimpleStrategy.sol, it is mentioned in the comments that 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool.
However, there is a lack of any checks.

## Impact
Anyone can call setPoolActive() and change the status without any restrictions.
