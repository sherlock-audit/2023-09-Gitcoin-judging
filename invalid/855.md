# `_transferAmount` function of `Transfer` library doesn't check if enough value has been sent for transfer
`_transferAmount` function of `Transfer` library doesn't check if enough value has been sent for transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail
`_transferAmount` is an internal function which is transfer an amount of a token to an address. Token can be Native token or anyother ERC20 token. Which doesn't check if `msg.value < amount` and revert with `AMOUNT_MISMATCH()` like the other helper function of same library. This function has been used at many places for transferring tokens
```solidity
File: contracts/core/libraries/Transfer.sol
    function _transferAmount(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
        if (_token == NATIVE) {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_to, _amount);
        } else {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, _to, _amount);
        }
    }
```

it doesn't check if `msg.value<amount` for transferring Native tokens.

## Impact
Unexpected error scenario and tx will revert

## Recommendation
add a check and revert with `AMOUNT_MISMATCH()` like the other helper functions
