# `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy::claim` doesn't support fee-on-transfer tokens

`DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy::claim` doesn't support fee-on-transfer tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

- `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol` strategy contract implements claiming mechanism; where the allocator sends tokens to the contract to be claimed later by the intended recipient:  
  [DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy::\_afterAllocate/Line 135](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-distribution-vault/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol#L135)

  ```solidity
  claims[recipientId][token] += amount;
  ```

- But if the funded token is of fee-on-transfer type where it deducts a fee on each transfer; then the saved amount to be claimed by the recipient would be greter than the amount sent by the allocator.

## Impact

So for this type of tokens; if all recipients tried to claim their funds, there would be insufficient funds and the last user will not be able to claim/withdraw his funded tokens.

## Code Snippet

[DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy::\_afterAllocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-distribution-vault/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol#L107-L136)

```solidity
    function _afterAllocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal override {
      // Decode the '_data' to get the recipientId, amount and token
      (address recipientId, Permit2Data memory p2Data) = abi.decode(_data, (address, Permit2Data));

      // Get the token address
      address token = p2Data.permit.permitted.token;
      uint256 amount = p2Data.permit.permitted.amount;

      if (token == NATIVE) {
          if (msg.value < amount) {
              revert AMOUNT_MISMATCH();
          }
          SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(address(this), amount);
      } else {
          PERMIT2.permitTransferFrom(
              // The permit message.
              p2Data.permit,
              // The transfer recipient and amount.
              ISignatureTransfer.SignatureTransferDetails({to: address(this), requestedAmount: amount}),
              // Owner of the tokens and signer of the message.
              _sender,
              // The packed signature that was the result of signing
              // the EIP712 hash of `_permit`.
              p2Data.signature
          );
      }

      // Update the total payout amount for the claim
      claims[recipientId][token] += amount;
  }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either prevent using fee-on-transfer tokens, or add a mechanism to handle it as checking the balance of the contract before and after and assign the difference as the claimable amount by the recipient.
