# The protocol doesn't work as expected with fee-on-transfer tokens
## Summary
The protocol doesn't work as expected with fee-on-transfer tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
This protocol is expected to work with every token and it is specifically stated that the fee-on-tokens are going to be used when funding a pool on `Allo.sol`.

`Allo::_fundPool()` function transfers the tokens from the `msg.sender` to the matching `strategy` contract using the Transfer library and then calls the `strategy.increasePoolAmount()` function.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L516C1-L517C54](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L516C1-L517C54)

```solidity
    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

-->     _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee})); //@audit The actual transferred amount is (amountAfterFee - feeOnTransferTokenTransferFee)
-->     _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee); //@audit this will update the poolAmount state variable in the strategy contract with the amountAfterFee. 

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```

`strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee)` function will update the `poolAmount` state variable with the inputted `amountAfterFee`. But unfortunately, that `amountAfterFee` and the actual transferred amount are not the same when working with fee-on-transfer tokens.

Fee-on-transfer tokens take extra fees on every transfer the actual transferred amounts are less than the inputted amount. In the function above, the actual amount transferred to the strategy contract will be `amountAfterFee - feeOnTransferTokenTransferFee`

This situation will create a mismatch between strategy contract balances and the `poolAmount` state variable, which may cause some disruptions when distributing the funds.

## Impact
Actual balance of the pool and the "balance on-paper" (`poolAmount`) will be different and this will cause disruptions when distributing the funds.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L516C1-L517C54

```solidity
       _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
       _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I would recommend checking the actual transferred amount and the balance of the strategy contracts when using fee-on-transfer tokens.
