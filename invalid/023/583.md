# Protocol transfer maybe failed if recipient is in token contract blacklist
## Summary

Protocol token transfer maybe failed if recipient is in token contract blacklist.

## Vulnerability Detail

Several contracts use `Transfer#_transferAmount` to transfer ERC20 token, such as [Allo contract](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L288) and [Registry contract](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L388). But some token contract may have blacklist mechanism, like USDT. When recipient is in blacklist, transfer will be failed and protocol will revert.

## Impact

Contract will dos when recipient is in token contract blacklist.

## Tool used

vscode, Manual Review

## Recommendation

Valid that recipient is not blacklisted, or use blacklist to prevent such ERC20 token transfer.
