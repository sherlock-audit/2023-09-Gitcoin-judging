# In DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy `_registerRecipient` wrongly sets the recipient after the first one
In DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy `_registerRecipient` wrongly sets the recipient after the first one, instead of giving the new recipient its own address it rather checks the value of whatever is already at zero index, if it is not none, instead of registering it simply skips, so no more than one recipient can be set.
## Vulnerability Detail
Look at the following code snippet in _registerRecipient;

```solidity
        uint8 currentStatus = _getUintRecipientStatus(recipientId);
```

So we get the current status using the function which for the first recipient will always be zero.

And it will be set righlty on index zero.

But if we try to again register the new recipient what will happen lets look at the above getter function:

lets say the index 0 is registers for alex for address(1)

Not we register the bob for with address(2), so he will have by default all the values zero:

```solidity
   function _getUintRecipientStatus(address _recipientId) internal view returns (uint8 status) {
        // Get the column index and current row
// @audit colIndex for the bob will be returned zero too
        (, uint256 colIndex, uint256 currentRow) = _getStatusRowColumn(_recipientId);

    

// @audit - here we shift by zero hence row remain same, and we get the status at index 0 for the bob, which is the status for the alice set to 0001, but for bob we should have returned the 0000
        status = uint8((currentRow >> colIndex) & 15);

        // Return the status
        return status;
    }
```
As above status returned is 0001 of alice for bob instead of 0000, bob is never registered, and everything in else is skipped:

```solidity
        if (currentStatus == uint8(Status.None)) {
            // recipient registering new application
            recipientToStatusIndexes[recipientId] = recipientsCounter;
            _setRecipientStatus(recipientId, uint8(Status.Pending));

            bytes memory extendedData = abi.encode(_data, recipientsCounter);
            emit Registered(recipientId, extendedData, _sender);

            recipientsCounter++;
        } else {
           
            if (currentStatus == uint8(Status.Accepted)) {
                // recipient updating accepted application
                _setRecipientStatus(recipientId, uint8(Status.Pending));
            } else if (currentStatus == uint8(Status.Rejected)) {
                // recipient updating rejected application
                _setRecipientStatus(recipientId, uint8(Status.Appealed));
            }
            emit UpdatedRegistration(recipientId, _data, _sender, _getUintRecipientStatus(recipientId));
        }
```

So the counter is never increase too. Because none is not returned and if is skipped.





## Impact
No more than 1 recipient can be registered, and only one index is used making the protocol whole usecase useless, probably skipped as the test cases only test for one recipient addition.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
WIll have to rewrite some parts to return zero for the non-registered users and rightly calculate the index and status.
