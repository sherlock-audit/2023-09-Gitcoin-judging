# Incorrect accounting in `_fundPool` for fee-on-transfer tokens
## Summary
`_fundPool` will increase the target pool's `poolAmount` by more than what is received if the pool token is a fee-on-transfer token, potentially locking funds and distributing more than intended to recipients (depending on the strategy).

## Vulnerability Detail
The contest README explicitly states that fee-on-transfer tokens may be used for funding pools. However, in `_fundPool` in the Allo contract, `poolAmount` is always increased by the amount transferred to the pool/strategy rather than the amount received.

```solidity
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);
```
(All the in scope strategies use the following `increasePoolAmount` function with no overrides and no implementation of the hooks)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/6430c8004017e96ae2f5aac365bdefd0b6eeea72/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L153-L157
```solidity
    function increasePoolAmount(uint256 _amount) external override onlyAllo {
        _beforeIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
        poolAmount += _amount;
        _afterIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
    }
```
If the pool token is a fee-on-transfer token, `poolAmount` will be increased by more than the token amount received. 

A example of an issue can be seen in the payout calculation implemented in the `QVBaseStrategy` contract (and used in `QVSimpleStrategy`) which returns a portion of `poolAmount` which would be inflated. Consequently, recipients will receive more funding than they are allotted and some distributions may be locked due to insufficient balance (in this case, there is no recovery function).

```solidity
        amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
```

## Impact
Incorrect accounting for `poolAmount` which could inflate funding received by recipients and lock tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider increasing the pool amount by the difference in the strategy's balance before and after the transfer.
