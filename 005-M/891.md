# _registerRecipient will always revert in case useRegistryAnchor is set to false in rftCommitteeStrategy.sol
_registerRecipient will always revert in case useRegistryAnchor is set to false in rftCommitteeStrategy.sol
## Vulnerability Detail
In `_registerRecipient`  function if the `useRegistryAnchor` is set to false we run into following code snippet:

```solidity
  //  @custom:data when 'false' -> (address recipientAddress, address registryAnchor, uint256 proposalBid, Metadata metadata)
            (recipientAddress, registryAnchor, proposalBid, metadata) =
                abi.decode(_data, (address, address, uint256, Metadata));

            // Check if the registry anchor is valid so we know whether to use it or not
            // we check if some registryAnchor is passed or not?
            isUsingRegistryAnchor = registryAnchor != address(0);

            // Ternerary to set the recipient id based on whether or not we are using the 'registryAnchor' or '_sender'
            recipientId = isUsingRegistryAnchor ? registryAnchor : _sender;

            // Checks if the '_sender' is a member of the profile 'anchor' being used and reverts if not
            if (isUsingRegistryAnchor && !_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
```

Here we can see that the declared `recipientAddress` is never set and remain set to 0, but right after this else statemetn we check for zero address for recipient address and revert on following line:

Which will happen always in case the useRegistryAnchor is false which is not intended and user should be still allowed to register.
## Impact
Function will not work as intended and the functionality will not work

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Set the recipientAddress in else condition too like other strategies.
