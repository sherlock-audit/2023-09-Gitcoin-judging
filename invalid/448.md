# Vulnerability in distributeSingle() where the hasBeenDistributed() check can be circumvented by directly calling _setDistributed().
There is a vulnerability in the _distributeSingle() function where the _hasBeenDistributed() check can be bypassed by directly calling _setDistributed().
## Vulnerability Detail
The _distributeSingle() function first calls _validateDistribution() to validate the distribution parameters like merkle proof. It then calls _hasBeenDistributed() to check if the distribution has already been claimed. If not, it calls _setDistributed() to mark it claimed, transfers the tokens, and emits an event.

However, since _setDistributed() is a private function, it can be called directly from outside the contract. An attacker could craft a transaction to call _setDistributed() for a distribution index directly without calling _distributeSingle(). This would mark the distribution as claimed without actually transferring tokens or emitting the event.

Then later, the attacker could call _distributeSingle() for the same distribution index again. This time, _hasBeenDistributed() would return false since the check was already circumvented. So _distributeSingle() would transfer the tokens again and emit the event again, effectively claiming the distribution twice.
## Impact
- Recipients can wrongfully be denied funds allocated to them.
- An attacker contract could call _setDistributed() directly without calling _validateDistribution(), allowing them to transfer tokens to any address, effectively stealing funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
setDistributed() should be made internal instead of private. This would prevent external calls to it, enforcing the check in _distributeSingle()
