# RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#_distribute() It is possible to distribute to a recipient who is not accepted
## Summary
It is possible to distribute to a recipient who is not accepted

## Vulnerability Detail
Distribution should only happen to accepted recipients which is assumed that will happen in the _allocation function where the recipients are accepted. However, it is possible to execute _distribute before _allocation and distribute the amount to the recipient that has not yet been accepted.

## Impact
Distribute to the recipient who has not yet been accepted

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {
        // check to make sure there is a pending milestone
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();


        IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        Recipient memory recipient = _recipients[acceptedRecipientId];


        // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
        if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();


        // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
        uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;


        // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
        poolAmount -= amount;
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);


        // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;


        // Increment the upcoming milestone
        upcomingMilestone++;


        // Emit events for the milestone and the distribution
        emit MilestoneStatusChanged(upcomingMilestone, Status.Accepted);
        emit Distributed(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
    }

## Recommendation
Check that the recipient is accepted
```solidity
if (recipient.recipientStatus != Status.Accepted) revert RECIPIENT_ERROR();
```
