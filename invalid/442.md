# Removed cloneable strategies can still be used
## Summary
A cloneable strategy that gets removed from allowed list is still useable.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
The [removeFromCloneableStrategies](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L251) function remove a probably faulty, outdated etc strategy from allowedlist and prevents them from being cloneable. However this doesn't address the real issue because, pools can still be created using these strategies through the [createPoolWithCustomStrategy](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L144).
This means unsuspecting users will have their pools based a faulty strategy. THis is especially more likely during emergencies (e.g one of the endorsed strategies is discovered vulnerable) and users don't get informed quickly enough.

## Impact
Pools can be created on a vulnerable strategy
