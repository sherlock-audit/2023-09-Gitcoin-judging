# Fee on transfer token is not supported properly.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the docs: https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/109

> Are there any FEE-ON-TRANSFER tokens interacting with the smart contracts?
> 
> Yes. When funding a pool on Allo.sol

The strategy assumes that it has received `_amount` and added it to `poolAmount`. However, due to the existence of a transfer fee, the actual amount of `_token` received is less than `_amount`, and `poolAmount` is an inflated value compared to the actual amount.

As a result, the calculated amount based on `poolAmount` is also higher than it should be.
