# The `SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH()` calls can be gas griefed
## Summary

[The comments above the `safeTransferETH()`](https://github.com/Vectorized/solady/blob/4ab2da16ff2ea34c7f078c24a079e1e248d460d4/src/utils/SafeTransferLib.sol#L46-L50) in the version Solady imported say

```solidity
    /// @dev Sends `amount` (in wei) ETH to `to`.
    /// Reverts upon failure.
    ///
    /// Note: This implementation does NOT protect against gas griefing.
    /// Please use `forceSafeTransferETH` for gas griefing protection.
```

## Vulnerability Detail

A malicious actor can construct a contract to use up a large amount of gas during the transfer, taking up more of the Allo contract or msg.sender's balance than expected.
