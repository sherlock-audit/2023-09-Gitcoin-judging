# When allocating native tokens in `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` any native token that exceeds the amount specified for funding is not returned

When a user allocates the native token to a recipient in `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` and sends a higher msg.value than the amount he specifies as an argument, only the amount of native token specified as an argument is added to the amount claimable by the recipient and the amount is send to the pool. The access native token is not refunded to the sender but remains in the Allo contract. Even though there is a check comparing msg.value with the amount specified, the function only reverts if the amount is bigger than msg.valu

## Vulnerability Detail
