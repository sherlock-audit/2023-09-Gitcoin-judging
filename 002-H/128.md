# In RFPSimpleStrategy, winning bid can use bait-and-switch to increase bid after acceptance and steal funds
## Summary

In RFPSimpleStrategy, neither setPoolActive nor registerRecipient  have proper access control.  This allows anyone to change their bid at any time, including right before a payout. This means that someone can win the RFP with a low bid, but change it to a much higher one before payout.

There is another attack that involves front-running allocate() with a bid-change. That is a separate issue. It is less guaranteed to succeed, but a fix to this issue will not fix that one, nor vice versa.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. Alice creates a pool with an RFPSimpleStrategy.  The pool is fully funded with a max bid of 100000 USDC, and a single milestone of 100%.
2. Eve calls allo.registerRecipient to submit a bid of 10000 USDC. The second highest bid is for 15000 USDC.
3. Alice calls allo.allocate and awards the RFP to Bob.
4. Bob completes the work.
5. Alice goes to call allo.distribute to grant Bob his 10000 USDC. HOWEVER...
6. ....Bob frontruns Allice's call with the following:

(this example is for if `useRegistryAnchor` is false)

```solidity
pool.setPoolActive(true);
allo.registerRecipient(poolId, abi.encode(bobsAddress, address(0), 100000 USDC, metadata))
pool.setPoolActive(false);
```

7. The result is that Alice intended to pay $10k, but has instead paid $100k. 

This also works in less dramatic fashion if there are multiple milestones.  For instance, the same would hold if there were two milestones of 50% each, the max bid and pool funding were both 100k USDC, and Bob also won on a 10k bid. Then Bob would only walk away with $50k before showing his dishonest intentions, but he'd also only need to hit the first milestone.

## Impact

Whenever the funding of a pool controlled by the RFPSimpleStrategy exceeds its max bid, people can steal funds by bidding small but taking money as if they bidded max.

## Code Snippet

See lack of access control on setPoolActive: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219

Also see how nothing in RFPSimpleStrategy._distribute will revert if the winning bid has been tampered with, even though calling _registerRecipient reverts recipient.recipientStatus to PENDING.
