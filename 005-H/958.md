# Allocator voiceCreditsCastToRecipient is incremented by the totalCredits instead of the new credits
## Summary

When an allocator allocates votes to the recipients, `totalCredits` is used to increment the `allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` but the new credits should be used instead because the `totalCredits` is the sum of the old credits + the new credits. 


## Vulnerability Detail

In `QVBaseStrategy.sol:: _qv_allocate()`, the `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` is used to track the credits that the allocator has already casted but the problem is that it is incremented by `totalCredits` instead of the new credits. 

`totalCredits` equals to `_voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient` but instead we only need to increment it by the `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` which are the new credits that are being allocated. 

So if an allocator allocates 100 voiceCredits for the first time and then the second time 100 more, the `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` will be 300 which is much bigger than its supposed to be and the 3rd time he allocates the votes the results will be completely different from what they are supposed to be

## Impact

The results arent going to be correct and the `_recipient.totalVotesReceived` will be much bigger than its supposed to be which will lead to unfair distribution of funds. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
517: uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
518: uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
519: 
520: // get the total credits and calculate the vote result
521: uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
522: uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);
523: 
524: // update the values
525: voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
526: totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
527: _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;
528: 
529: _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
530: _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;
```

As you can see here the `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;` which will add the old credits + the new credits. 

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Increment by the `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` instead of the `totalCredits`
