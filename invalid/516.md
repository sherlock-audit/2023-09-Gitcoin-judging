# The votes mapping and votedFor mapping can get out of sync
The votes mapping and votedFor mapping are not kept in sync. votedFor is updated on each call but votes is only incremented. So they could get out of sync
## Vulnerability Detail
1. The votedFor mapping keeps track of which recipient an allocator has voted for: [Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-committee/RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol#L51)
2. This is updated whenever an allocator casts a new vote: [Link 2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-committee/RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol#L120)
3. However, the votes mapping which tracks the total votes for each recipient is only incremented when a new vote is cast: [Link 3](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-committee/RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol#L118)

This means that if an allocator changes their vote from recipient A to recipient B, the votedFor mapping will be updated to reflect the new vote, but the votes mapping will not be decremented for recipient A.
So over time, as allocators change their votes, the votes mapping can end up higher than the actual latest votes reflected in votedFor


## Impact
This could allow a recipient to be accepted even if they don't actually have enough votes according to the latest votedFor data.
For example, say the voteThreshold is 5.
•	Allocator 1 votes for Recipient A
•	Allocator 2 votes for Recipient A
•	Allocator 3 votes for Recipient A
•	Allocator 1 changes vote to Recipient B
•	Allocator 2 changes vote to Recipient B
Now based on the latest votes, Recipient B has 2 votes and Recipient A has 1 vote.
But because votes for Recipient A was never decremented, the votes mapping will show:
Recipient A: 3 votes Recipient B: 2 votes
So Recipient A could end up getting accepted even though they don't have enough votes per the latest votedFor data.

## Recommendation
The votes mapping needs to be decremented when a vote changes
