# Users have to pay more than the requirement to successfully create a pool
## Summary
While creating a pool , users should pay `baseFee + _amount ` if the token is native or only the `baseFee` if the token is not native .  
However , this is not implemented correctly in the `_createPool` function . Current logics are : 
1. Users have to pay more than  `baseFee + _amount ` if the funding  token is native. 
2. Users have to pay more than  `baseFee` if the  funding token is not native .  

Instead , It should be like this : 
1. Users have to pay   exactly  `baseFee + _amount ` if the funding  token is native.  Excess funds are returned to the caller if sent mistakenly . 
2. Users have to pay   exactly  `baseFee` if the  funding token is not native .  Excess funds are returned to the caller if sent mistakenly . 
## Vulnerability Detail
Even if caller send equal amount of required asset then it still reverts . 

The problematic code from `_createPool` function in `Allo.sol`  : 

```solidity

 if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) { //@ci M-03: Looks like it want the basefee+amount should be less than msg.value , otherwise here it reverts . But issue is if sent amount is equal to required amount then it still reverts ! 
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee); //reviewed : looks fine .  this looks like eth transfer is happening from allo contract . make it sure first . if the assumption is correct , then if there is not sufficient fund in allo contract then this call will fail . A potential dos  issue if base fee is pretty large .  
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
```
## Impact
Loss of funds for the pool creator .

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rewrite the code as below : 
```solidity 
- if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) { }
+ if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) { }
```
