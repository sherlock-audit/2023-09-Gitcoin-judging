# Pool status can toggled by anyone .
## Summary
In `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` , Pool status defines if a pool is active or not . This dictates some functionalities of a pool like  `withdraw` functionality  , `_registerRecipient` functionality , `_allocate` functionality  etc.  However , the `function setPoolActive` lacks access control which lets anyone to change the status of pools using RFPSimpleStrategy . This is really alarming cause pools will malfunction in case the issue is exploited . 

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity 
 function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external { //@ci M-02 : no access control noticed  ?? 
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag); //@q can pool activity continue after pool is closed ?? 
    }
```
## Impact
Certain functionalities will get DOS'ed of exploited pool .
