# RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#_distribute() - Rebasing tokens won't work correctly
## Summary
The protocol clearly states that it supports all sort of tokens, including rebasing tokens.
Rebasing tokens adjust their token supply based on their price. 
This will lead to problems in the `_distribute` function, as we use `poolAmount` to determine how many tokens are actually in the strategy. A situation can arise where the `poolAmount` and the actual token balance of the contract differ in a significant way leading to incorrect accounting and award distribution if the token supply went up or reverting of the whole tx if the token supply goes down.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take a look if the rebasing token's supply goes up:
The following is a scenario where the whole `poolAmount` must go to the `acceptedRecipientAddress`

`maxBid = 100`
`recipient.proposalBid = 100`
`milestone.amountPercentage = 1e18`
`poolAmount = 100`.

The price of the token goes up by 50%, so the actual token balance of  the contract becomes 150, but the `poolAmount` is still 100.

The pool manager calls `_distribute` and the `amount` that must be payed to the `acceptedRecipientAddress` should be 150, because he has to receive the whole token balance of the pool, but instead, because `poolAmount = 100`, he will only receive 100 tokens, not the 150 he should receive.

Let's imagine if the rebasing token's supply goes down:
The scenario is the same as the one above.

`maxBid = 100`
`recipient.proposalBid = 100`
`milestone.amountPercentage = 1e18`
`poolAmount = 100`.

The price of the token goes down by 50%, so the actual token balance of the contract becomes 50, but the `poolAmount` is still  100.

The pool manager calls `_distribute` and the `amount` that must be payed to the `acceptedRecipientAddress` should be 50, but because `poolAmount = 100` the whole tx will revert when we hit `_transferAmount`, because we are attempting to transfer 100 tokens, while the contract only holds 50 tokens. In this situation `acceptedRecipientAddress` won't receive anything, even though he should receive 100% of the token balance of the contract, which is 50 at that time.

If the token supply goes down, `_distribute` won't revert every single time, but it will still lead to incorrect accounting and reward distribution, because we are using `poolAmount` to base the rewards calculation for a certain milestone, which will be out of sync with the actual token balance.

## Impact
Incorrect accounting, unfair reward distribution and in some cases bricking of the `_distribute` function.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
A simple fix would be to add a line inside `_distribute` that sets `poolAmount = pool.token.balanceOf(address(this))` or something similar. An external function can also be added to correctly update the `poolAmount`  to the actual token balance of the contract.
