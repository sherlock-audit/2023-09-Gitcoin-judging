# Distribution for a rejected milestone is allowed
The RFPSimpleStrategy.sol smart contract allows distribution for rejected milestones.

## Vulnerability Detail
After an approved recipient submits his milestone data, the milestone can be rejected by the pool managers. The [distribute function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L417-L450), however, allows distributing to the recipient even if his milestone is rejected. 

## Impact
Incorrect distribution of funds.

## Code Snippet
```jsx
    function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {
        // check to make sure there is a pending milestone
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

        IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        Recipient memory recipient = _recipients[acceptedRecipientId];

        // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
        if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();

        // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
        uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;

        // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
        poolAmount -= amount;
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

        // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;

        // Increment the upcoming milestone
        upcomingMilestone++;

        // Emit events for the milestone and the distribution
        emit MilestoneStatusChanged(upcomingMilestone, Status.Accepted);
        emit Distributed(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Check if the milestone is rejected and revert if it is.
