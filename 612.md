# Absence of a Function to Withdraw Funds from the `Anchor` contract
## Summary
The `Anchor` contract currently does not have a function that allows for the withdrawal of funds (Ether) that have been sent to it. This means that any Ether sent to the contract cannot be retrieved, effectively becoming locked within the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The contract includes a fallback function to receive Ether:
```solidity
receive() external payable {}
```
This function allows the contract to accept Ether sent to it. However, once the Ether is sent to the contract, there is no function within the contract that allows for the withdrawal or transfer of those funds to another address. This means that any Ether sent to the contract is irretrievable and becomes permanently locked within the contract.

## Impact
The impact of this issue is financial loss. If a user accidentally sends Ether to the contract, or if the contract is designed to accumulate Ether for some reason (e.g., as part of its functionality), those funds become inaccessible and are effectively lost. This could potentially lead to significant financial loss, depending on the amount of Ether sent to the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this issue, a withdrawal function should be added to the contract. This function should include appropriate access controls to ensure that only authorized addresses (e.g., the contract owner) can withdraw funds. Here is a simple example of what this function could look like:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    require(amount <= address(this).balance, "Insufficient balance");
    payable(owner).transfer(amount);
}
```
In this example, `onlyOwner` is a modifier that restricts the withdraw function to the owner of the contract, and owner is a state variable that stores the owner's address. This function allows the owner to withdraw a specified amount of Ether from the contract, provided that the contract has a sufficient balance.
