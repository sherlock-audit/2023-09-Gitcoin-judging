# Funding a pool on `Allo.sol` would not be compatible and accurate with Fee-on-transfer tokens
## Summary
It is stated in the ReadMe file that it is expected for Fee-on-Transfer tokens to be able to interact with the protocol when funding a pool, but that is not true, which will make the balances of the pools inaccurate.
## Vulnerability Detail
As can be seen in the context Q&A of the protocol it is stated that  Fee-on-transfer tokens should be able to interact with the protocol when funding pools

but that is not really the case.
When `_fundPool` is called to fund a specific pool the `amountAfterFee` gets transferred 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L516
and then the `increasePoolAmount` is called on the strategy with the same `amountAfterFee`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L517
which will increase the `poolAmount` variable on the strategy 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L155
, but in the cases of  Fee-on-transfer tokens, less amount then `amountAfterFee` will actually arrive at the strategy, since every transfer takes some fees away. So in that situation the `poolAmount` will be inflated and not actually true, since the real `balanceOf` the strategy contract will be increased by less than `amountAfterFee`.
## Impact
Impact is a medium one since it messes the accuracy of the pools and also these tokens are not compatible as it is stated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If you intend to work with Fee-on-transfer tokens then you should check the `balanceOf` the strategy contract before the transfer and after the transfer, and call `increasePoolAmount` on the strategy contract with the difference of those two values.
