# RFPSimpleStrategy#submitUpcomingMilestone
Function `submitUpcomingMilestone` in RFPSimpleStrategy is used by the `acceptedRecipient` to submit his "proof of work" and eventually receive his payment for the completion of this milestone. 

Therefore, it makes sense that only the `acceptedRecipient` should be able to submit milestones as he's the one doing the work. This is also confirmed by the comments for the function:
```solidity
/// @notice Submit milestone by the acceptedRecipientId.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be the 'acceptedRecipientId' and must be a member
    ///      of a 'Profile' to sumbit a milestone. Emits a 'MilestonesSubmitted()' event.
    /// @param _metadata The proof of work
    function submitUpcomingMilestone(Metadata calldata _metadata) external {
        // Check if the 'msg.sender' is the 'acceptedRecipientId' and is a member of the 'Profile'
        if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender && !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)) {
            revert UNAUTHORIZED();
        }

        // Check if the upcoming milestone is in fact upcoming
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

        // Get the milestone and update the metadata and status
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        milestone.metadata = _metadata;

        // Set the milestone status to 'Pending' to indicate that the milestone is submitted
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Pending;

        // Emit event for the milestone
        emit MilstoneSubmitted(upcomingMilestone);
    }
```
However, the current implementation lets anyone submit upcoming milestones as long as he's just a profile member.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take a look at the check that is supposed to make sure that the user submitting the milestone is `acceptedRecipient` and is a `profileMember`:
```solidity
        // Check if the 'msg.sender' is the 'acceptedRecipientId' and is a member of the 'Profile'
        if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender && !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)) {
            revert UNAUTHORIZED();
        }
```
However, passing this check requires `msg.sender` to only be a profile member as `!_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)` will return 0 and we won't enter the if.

The result is that any member of the profile can submit upcoming milestones which is obviously not the intention of the logic and it severely hurts the contracts' functionality as this is one of the most essential functions.

The PoolOwner can reject milestones but if you can't trust that the submitted milestones are coming from the person who is supposed to be submitting them then the whole reason for such a function to exist doesn't make sense.
## Impact
Any member can submit upcoming milestones with whatever fake "proof of work" he wants pretty much making the whole Milestones functionality useless.

## Recommendation
Replace the `&&` with `||`:
```solidity
        if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender || !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)) {
            revert UNAUTHORIZED();
        }
```
