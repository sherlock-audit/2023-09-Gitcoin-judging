# Recipients can still be registered after the vote has started.
The end time for the registration must be earlier than the start time for the allocation, otherwise recipients can still be registered after the vote has started.

## Vulnerability Detail
The end time for the registration must be earlier than the start time for the allocation.
**_registrationEndTime > _allocationEndTime** should be changed to **_registrationEndTime > _allocationStartTime**.
