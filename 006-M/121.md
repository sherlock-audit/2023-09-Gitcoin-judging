# The distribute function in RFPSimpleStrategy.sol might fail due to lacking funds even when there are enough funds

The distribute function in RFPSimpleStrategy.sol might fail dur to lacking funds even when there are enough funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The function _distribute always fails when recipient.proposalBid is greater than poolAmount, even though the actual amount paid is less the recipient.proposalBid. This could create situations where the amount that should be paid is less than poolAmount, thus payable by the contract, but the function fails.

## Impact

The contract could fail to pay recipients in many legitimate situations.

## Recommendation

Use the amount variable set in the next line for the comparison instead of recipient.proposalBid.
