# QVSimpleStrategy doesn't accept ETH
## Summary

Contrary to assumed intention, QVSimpleStrategy has no `receive` or `fallback` function to accept ETH as funding.

## Vulnerability Detail

QVSimpleStrategy has no `receive` or `fallback` method to accept ETH as funding. Since every other strategy accepts ETH as funding, and there's no clear reason as to why this strategy should not also accept ETH, I believe that this is unintended. There is also no logic that prevents ETH as being the token used during initialization which can result in a costly deployment of a strategy which doesn't function as intended.

## Impact

QVSimpleStrategy cannot accept ETH as funding, potentially resulting in a costly deployment of a strategy which doesn't function as intended.

(lack of logic)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include a `receive` method as is done with the other strategies, or if not intended to accept ETH, prevent the pool token as being set to ETH in initialization logic.
