# Donation strategy allocate() & distribute() can be called in the same block
In `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol` the functions `allocate()` and `distribute()` can be called in the same block contrary to developers assumptions. This could lead to issues with integration of the strategy by other smart contracts or off-chain components
## Vulnerability Detail
The implementations of the mentioned modifiers - `_checkOnlyActiveAllocation` & `_checkOnlyAfterAllocation` does not work according to the developer's assumptions when `block.timestamp = allocationEndTime`. The issue is that `_checkOnlyAfterAllocation()` won't revert since `block.timestamp` isn't `<` `allocationEndTime` (they are equal), therefore at the `allocationEndTime` block both `allocate()` and `distribute()` can be executed in the same block which shouldn't be allowed.
## Impact
This could lead to integration issues with smart contracts / off-chain systems

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Rework the after allocation modifier to such
```solidity
function _checkOnlyAfterAllocation() internal view virtual {
        if (block.timestamp <= allocationEndTime) revert ALLOCATION_NOT_ENDED();
    }
```
