# function _createPool in Allo.sol requires value to be greater than baseFee
## Summary
When creating a new pool, under function _**_createPool**_ in _**Allo.sol**_ , if there is a base fee (i.e. baseFee > 0), the creator of the pool is required to send more ETH than the baseFee amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
The amount of ETH to be sent when invoking _**createPool**_ (and hence _**_createPool**_) is required to be greater than the _**baseFee**_. When creating a pool and not adding any amount to the pool, **_msg.value_** should be equal to the _**baseFee.**_ The amount in excess gets locked in _**Allo.sol**_ and can only be recovered by the Allo owner by invoking **_recoverFunds_**.

## Impact
Users have to spend more ETH than **_baseFee_** in order to create a pool.

## Tool used
Manual Review.

## Recommendation
Change the condition to:
` if(
       (_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) ||
       (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)
      ) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();`
         }
