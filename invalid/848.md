# Checks Effects Interaction pattern not followed
The CEI pattern is not followed in function _**_distribute**_ in contract _**QVBaseStrategy.sol**_ and in function _**_afterAllocate**_ in _**DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy.sol**_.

## Vulnerability Detail
The CEI pattern is used in order to reduce the possibility of a malicious contract trying to hijack control after an external call. It is mainly used to prevent reentrancy attacks.
In these two functions, the Effects bit is performed the last one. Even if the functions have a _**Nonreentrant**_ modifier, it is always good practice to follow the CEI pattern.

## Impact
External calls are executed before the balances are updated.
In the case of the function _**_distribute**_ , the recipient is updated as paid (i.e. _**paidOut[recipientId] = true**_) after transferring the payment.
In the case of the function _**_afterAllocate**_, the payout amounts are updated as the last step (i.e. _**claims[recipientId][token] += amount**_).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Follow the CEI pattern and update the status before interacting with external contracts.
