# A user who is not the accepted recipient can submit an upcoming milestone
The validation check on the `submitUpcomingMilestone` can be bypassed by a user who is not the accepted recipient.
## Vulnerability Detail
In RFPSimpleStrategy.sol a new milestone can be submitted using the `submitUpcomingMilestone` function. It is intended for only the `acceptedRecipientId` to be able to submit an upcoming milestone, so the following check is made in the ``submitUpcomingMilestone` function:
```solidity
if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender && !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)) {
    revert UNAUTHORIZED();
}
```
The issue is that this allows for the `msg.sender` to not be the `acceptedRecipientId` if they are a profile member, as `acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender` would be `true`, but `!_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)` would return false. As the `&&` operator is used the `revert UNAUTHORIZED();` would not be executed and the function call would be successful.
## Impact
Unauthorized users can set the upcoming milestone.

    revert UNAUTHORIZED();
}
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use an `OR (||)` operator instead of an `AND (&&)` operator, making it necessary for both statements to be false in order to not revert the call.
