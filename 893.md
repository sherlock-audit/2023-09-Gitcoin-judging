# Fund recovery mechanism is broken for merkle vault
## Summary
Stuck funds for Merkle Vault strategy in case recipient fails to claim them

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
        if (block.timestamp <= allocationEndTime + 30 days) {
            revert INVALID();
        }

        IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);

        if (_amount > poolAmount) {
            revert INVALID();
        }

        poolAmount -= _amount;

        // Transfer the tokens to the 'msg.sender' (pool manager calling function)
        _transferAmount(pool.token, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```

Merkle strategies have a`withdraw()` function which only supports withdrawing `pool.token`. However, since these strategies support multiple tokens through `allowedList` a sponsor can allocate non `pool.token` tokens to a pool. Assuming this is a merkle vault the funds will be held by the contract. If a partcipant fails to claim them for some reason
the pool manager won't be able to withdraw them. `distribute` won't work either since it only supports `pool.token`.

## Impact

In case of emergency -- participant failed to claim tokens for Merkle Vault strategy it'll be stuck in the contract with no way to recover.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review
Consider reimplementing withdraw:


## Recommendation

```solidity
    function withdraw(address token, uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
        if (block.timestamp <= allocationEndTime + 30 days) {
            revert INVALID();
        }

        // Transfer the tokens to the 'msg.sender' (pool manager calling function)
        _transferAmount(token, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```
