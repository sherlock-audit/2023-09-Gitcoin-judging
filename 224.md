# baseFee won't be transferred to the treasury if the Native token is not eth
## Summary
baseFee won't be transferred to the treasury if the Native token is not eth

## Vulnerability Detail
```Solidity
 function _transferAmount(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
        if (_token == NATIVE) {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_to, _amount);
        } else {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, _to, _amount);
        }
```
In the above code snippet the solady's `SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_to, _amount);` is called and 
```Solidity
/// @dev Sends `amount` (in wei) ETH to `to`.
    function safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 amount) internal {
        /// @solidity memory-safe-assembly
        assembly {
            if iszero(call(gas(), to, amount, gas(), 0x00, gas(), 0x00)) {
                mstore(0x00, 0xb12d13eb) // `ETHTransferFailed()`.
                revert(0x1c, 0x04)
            }
        }
```
above is the safeTransferETH() that is only used to transfer eth in wei and since the protocol says that NATIVE token can be Eth/polygon or any other token then the problem is if the native token is some token with decimal of less than or more than 18 the base fee won't get transferred to the treasury. 
## Impact
baseFee won't be transferred to the treasury if the Native token is not eth
## Code Snippet
```Solidity
 function _transferAmount(address _token, address _to, uint256 _amount) internal {
        if (_token == NATIVE) {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_to, _amount);
        } else {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransfer(_token, _to, _amount);
        }
```

## Recommendation
Don't use solady for this purpose Consider using OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 instead.
