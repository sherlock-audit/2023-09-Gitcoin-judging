# Malicious recipient can frontrun `reviewRecipients` with a call to `registerRecipient`
## Summary

Consider a strategy deployed with `QVBaseStrategy` as the basis (e.g. `QVSimpleStrategy`). A malicious recipient can first register themselves with an acceptable `recipientAddress` and `Metadata`, wait for `reviewThreshold - 1` reviewers to approve, and then front-run the last reviewer's call to `reviewRecipients` with an unacceptable `recipientAddress` and `Metadata`, but they will be approved regardless of the change. 

## Vulnerability Detail

First, let's assume that `registryGating` in `QVBaseStrategy` is off (it doesn't affect the exploit, but just for simplicity). The malicious recipient will first call `registerRecipient` on `Allo.sol`, which calls `_registerRecipient` in `QVBaseStrategy`, with a reasonable `recipientAddress` and `metadata`. They will set `registryAnchor` to the zero address so that their sending address becomes the `recipientId` (again doesn't affect the exploit but just for simplicity). 

Then, they will wait for `reviewThreshold - 1` reviewers to call `reviewRecipients` in `QVBaseStrategy.sol` and approve this.  Because `reviewRecipients` has this logic:

```solidity
            if (
                reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus] >= reviewThreshold
            ) {
                Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
                recipient.recipientStatus = recipientStatus;

                emit RecipientStatusUpdated(
                    recipientId,
                    recipientStatus,
                    address(0)
                );
            }
```

which just uses the `recipientId` and `recipientStatus` to find the number of votes, without any other checks, the malicious recipient can now wait for the last reviewer to send an approving transaction. The malicious recipient then frontruns this approving transaction with a call to `registerRecipient` on `Allo.sol` again, except this time the malicious recipient puts in a malicious `recipientAddress` and `metadata`. `_registerRecipient` in `QVBaseStrategy` will let this change go through and keep the `recipientStatus` as `Status.Pending`. Because `reviewRecipients` has no check to see if the recipients data for the relevant `recipientId` was modified, it will lead to the new malicious recipient data with the malicious `recipientAddress` and `metadata` being approved. This malicious recipient can then be allocated to once the registration period ends and the allocation period starts. 

Pretty much the same issue seems to exist in `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy`, where a malicious recipient can frontrun `reviewRecipients` with `_registerRecipient`. 

## Impact

Malicious recipient can potentially get malicious data approved by reviewers, even if the reviewers would not have approved the data if they had seen it initially.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

You should track a `changeId` in `_registerRecipient` in `QVBaseStrategy` for every `recipientId`. Then, every call to `reviewRecipients` should contain an array of the `changeId` variables for every `recipientId` which `reviewRecipients` can then compare to the latest value of the `changeId` variables to see if they match.
