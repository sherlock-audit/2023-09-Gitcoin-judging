# Recipients status malfunctions in QV Strategies
## Summary
If we have a review threshold of 2 when using _reviewRecipients()_, a recipient will be _rejected_ with two rejections from pool managers. But, if he then gets 2 acceptations, his status will change to _accepted_, even if he already was _rejected_ . We also have to take into account that the recipient is _accepted_ with the same amount of rejections and acceptations.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say we have a _reviewThreshold_ of 2. If 2 pool managers review a recipient and reject it, his status will be _rejected_, which shouldn't change. After that, another 2 pool managers review the recipient and accept it. His status will change to _accepted_. This shouldn't be possible because he already was rejected, and most importantly because _numberOfRejections == numberOfAcceptations_. Here is a PoC:

    function test_reviewRecipientsMalfunctioning() public {
        address recipientId = __register_recipient();

        address[] memory recipientIds = new address[](1);
        recipientIds[0] = recipientId;
        IStrategy.Status[] memory Statuses = new IStrategy.Status[](1);
        Statuses[0] = IStrategy.Status.Rejected;
        IStrategy.Status[] memory AcceptedStatuses = new IStrategy.Status[](1);
        AcceptedStatuses[0] = IStrategy.Status.Accepted;

        // We reject the recipient 2 times, with a reviewThreshold == 2
        vm.startPrank(pool_manager1());
        qvStrategy().reviewRecipients(recipientIds, Statuses);

        vm.startPrank(pool_manager2());
        qvStrategy().reviewRecipients(recipientIds, Statuses);

        // The recipient has been rejected
        QVBaseStrategy.Recipient memory recipientRejected = qvStrategy().getRecipient(recipientId);
        assertEq(uint8(IStrategy.Status.Rejected), uint8(recipientRejected.recipientStatus));

        // This recipient should be rejected, because has 2 rejections
        // If he now gets 2 acceptations, we will be accepted, even if numOfRejections == numOfAccepts 
        vm.startPrank(pool_manager1());
        qvStrategy().reviewRecipients(recipientIds, AcceptedStatuses);

        vm.startPrank(pool_manager2());
        qvStrategy().reviewRecipients(recipientIds, AcceptedStatuses);

        // After 2 acceptations, his status changes to Accepted
        QVBaseStrategy.Recipient memory recipientAccepted = qvStrategy().getRecipient(recipientId);
        assertEq(uint8(IStrategy.Status.Accepted), uint8(recipientAccepted.recipientStatus));
    }

## Impact
Recipients may end up having a _status_ they shouldn't, leading to unexpected behaviour.

## Tool used

Manual Review and Foundry

## Recommendation
Don't let to review a recipient that already got _rejected_ or _accepted_.
