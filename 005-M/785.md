# Incorrect Calculation in Voice Credit Allocation
## Summary

The miscalculation in voice credit allocation results in an inflated vote count, skewing the intended distribution of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_qv_allocate` function in the QVBaseStrategy calculates voice credits and votes for a recipient by retrieving prior values and summing them with new voice credits. This leads to the calculation of total accumulated credits and the resulting vote.

                uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
                uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId]; 

                // get the total credits and calculate the vote result
                uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
                uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);

The issue arises when updating the `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` variable. It should only incorporate the incremental voice credits to the existing sum, rather than the total accumulated credits.

                _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L529

It leads to an inflated `voiceCreditsCastToRecipient`. If an allocator allocates multiple times to a single recipient, both the `voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` and the `vote` result will be inaccurately high.

## Impact

The inflated vote count allows recipients to receive more funds than they should, undermining the system's fairness and security.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the code to update only the incremental voice credits, not the total sum:

```diff
-       _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
+       _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += _voiceCreditsToAllocate;
```
