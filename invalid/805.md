# Missing Check for `milestoneStatus == Status.Pending` in the `_distribute` Function in `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol`
The `_distribute` function in `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` lacks a check for the `milestoneStatus` of milestones to ensure they are in the Pending state before distribution. This oversight allows for the distribution of milestones that might have been rejected or not set to pending state by the Recipient, potentially leading to incorrect fund distrubution.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_distribute` function of `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol`, there is a missing check for the` milestoneStatus` of milestones to ensure they are in the `Pending state` before proceeding with the distribution. The current implementation allows for the distribution of milestones regardless of their status, which could lead to incorrect fund distribution if milestones are not in the expected state.
## Impact
This can lead to unintended fund distribution for incorrect `milestoneStatus`and potentially disrupt the intended flow of the RFP pool strategy.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {
        // check to make sure there is a pending milestone
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

        IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        Recipient memory recipient = _recipients[acceptedRecipientId];

        // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
        if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();

        // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
        uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;

        // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
        poolAmount -= amount;
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

        // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;

        // Increment the upcoming milestone
        upcomingMilestone++;

        // Emit events for the milestone and the distribution
        emit MilestoneStatusChanged(upcomingMilestone, Status.Accepted);
        emit Distributed(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
    }

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check in the `_distribute` function to ensure that milestones are in the `Pending state` before proceeding with distribution. This will help prevent incorrect fund distribution and maintain the expected behavior of the RFP pool strategy.
