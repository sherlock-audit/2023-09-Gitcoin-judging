# lack payable in execute()
 Missing payable prevents users from executing transactions that requires ether.
## Vulnerability Detail
```c
    function execute(address _target, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) external returns (bytes memory) {
        // Check if the caller is the owner of the profile and revert if not
        if (!registry.isOwnerOfProfile(profileId, msg.sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();

        // Check if the target address is the zero address and revert if it is
        if (_target == address(0)) revert CALL_FAILED();

        // Call the target address and return the data
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_data);

        // Check if the call was successful and revert if not
        if (!success) revert CALL_FAILED();

        return data;
    }

```

As can be seen, the function execute lacks the payable , although the contract has the receive() external payable {} function to receive ether. This can allow a front-running attack if a user sends ether and then calls execute
## Impact
execute can revert when _value =! 0
