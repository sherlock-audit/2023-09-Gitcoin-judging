# RFPCommitteeStrategy `_allocate` method missing `onlyActivePool` and `nonReentrant` modifier
## Summary
The `RFPCommitteeStrategy` contract inherits from `RFPSimpleStrategy` and contains a security vulnerability in the `_allocate` method. This method lacks the `onlyActivePool` and `nonReentrant` modifiers, which can lead to potential issues.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_allocate` method in the `RFPCommitteeStrategy` contract overrides the virtual method defined in the `RFPSimpleStrategy` contract. However, it does not include the necessary `onlyActivePool` and `nonReentrant` modifiers, which introduces potential security vulnerabilities.

## Impact
The absence of the `nonReentrant` modifier in the `_allocate` method exposes the contract to reentrancy attacks, allowing an attacker to manipulate the contract's state and potentially drain funds.

The missing `onlyActivePool` modifier allows allocation to occur even in closed pools, leading to incorrect allocation calculations and unauthorized access to funds or resources.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-committee/RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol#L102
The `_allocate` method defined in `RFPSimpleStrategy`
```solidity

    function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        nonReentrant
        onlyActivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
```
The override `_allocate` method in `RFPCommitteeStrategy`
```solidity
    function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal override onlyPoolManager(_sender) 
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add modifiers to `_allocate` method.
```solidity
    function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) 
        internal
        override
        nonReentrant
        onlyActivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender) {
        if (acceptedRecipientId != address(0)) {
            revert RECIPIENT_ALREADY_ACCEPTED();
        }
    ........
    }
```
