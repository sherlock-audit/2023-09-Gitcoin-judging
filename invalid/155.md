# The owner of the profile should be able to take back the ownership of the pool created by the removed member.
## Summary

Members of profiles have the ability to create pools. And the creator of the pool is granted an admin role. The owner of the profile has the ability to remove the members. However, if the owner tries to remove a member who has created some pools, the owner cannot take back the ownership of those pools.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Allo._createPool` grants an admin role to the pool creator. And the pool creator could be the member of the profile.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L446
```solidity
    function _createPool(
        bytes32 _profileId,
        IStrategy _strategy,
        bytes memory _initStrategyData,
        address _token,
        uint256 _amount,
        Metadata memory _metadata,
        address[] memory _managers
    ) internal returns (uint256 poolId) {
        if (!registry.isOwnerOrMemberOfProfile(_profileId, msg.sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();

        …

        // Grant admin roles to the pool creator
        _grantRole(POOL_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender);

        …
    }
```

And the owner of the profile has the ability to remove members.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L306
```solidity
    function removeMembers(bytes32 _profileId, address[] memory _members) external onlyProfileOwner(_profileId) {
        uint256 memberLength = _members.length;

        // Loop through the members and remove them from the profile by revoking the role
        for (uint256 i; i < memberLength;) {
            // Revoke the role from the member and emit the event for each member
            _revokeRole(_profileId, _members[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```

But the owner cannot take back the ownerships of the pools created by removed members.

## Impact

When the owner needs to remove the member, the removed member is not trusted anymore.  It is dangerous that the removed member still has the ownership of the pools.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`Allo._createPool` should implement a `changePoolAdmin` function that can only be called by the owner of the profile.
