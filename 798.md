# `_registerRecipient` in the `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` will revert 100% if `useRegistryAnchor` is true
## Summary
The function `_registerRecipient` which is used to register new recipients in `RFPSimpleStrategy` will revert all the time when `useRegistryAnchor` is set to true, which will make the whole strategy unusable.
## Vulnerability Detail
As can be seen the function `_registerRecipient` first check if `useRegistryAnchor` is true or not and will decode the data used in the call different in both situations

After that it will do other checks on metadata

`proposalBid`

and in the end for the `recipientAddress`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L361-L362
The problem relies in the fact that if the `useRegistryAnchor` is true there is no updates on the `recipientAddress` varibales, as can be seen here, when `abi.decode` is called 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L327-L332
so when it will get to the `recipientAddress` check, the `if` statement will always be true since `recipientAddress` is not updated anywhere and will be `address(0)`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L362
Because of that no recipient can be registered if `useRegistryAnchor` global variable is set to true.
## Impact
Impact is a high one since the whole logic of the contract would fail by not letting the recipients register.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the `recipientAddress` variable when you use `abi.decode` so the `if` statement would not be true and revert.
