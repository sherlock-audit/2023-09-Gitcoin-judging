# ````_createPool()```` requires to pay more than expected fund
## Summary
The ````Equal```` case of ````paying amount```` VS ````required amount```` is not processed correctly in ````_createPool()````, users must pay a little more fund than it should be.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises on L473, it would revert even exact enough ````msg.value```` is sent.
```diff
File: contracts\core\Allo.sol
415:     function _createPool(
...
423:     ) internal returns (uint256 poolId) {
...
468: 
469:         if (baseFee > 0) {
...
-473:             if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
+473:             if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
474:                 revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS(); 
475:             }
476:             _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
477:             emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
478:         }
479: 
...
485:     }



```

## Impact
Though fund loss should be negligible, but user experience would become really bad.
Let's say if depositing amount is 10 ETH plus 0.1 ETH ````baseFee````,  in normal case, users only need to type ````10.1````. But now they should type up to 18 decimals (````10.100000000000000001````).
