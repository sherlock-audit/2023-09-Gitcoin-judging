# attacker can steal funds of allo.sol by using fundPool() function
The` Allo` contract contains a vulnerability where an attacker can potentially steal Ether from the contract by sending a `msg.value` greater than `_amount` when using the fundPool` function.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `Allo` contract, there is a function called `fundPool` that allows anyone to deposit Ether into a pool. This function takes two arguments: _poolId and _amount. However, there is a vulnerability in this function that allows an attacker to send more Ether (msg.value) than the specified `_amount`.
Lets suppose Allo hold 1 eth, malicious can just fund pool with amount = 100 eth, msg.value = 99 eth, which basically steal 1 eth from Allo contract

## Impact
This vulnerability allows an attacker to steal Ether from the Allo contract by sending a larger msg.value than the intended _amount. This can result in a loss of funds for the contract and negatively impact the overall functionality of the Allo protocol.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a check that at the appropriate msg.value is sent
