# Wrongly updating ````voiceCreditsCastToRecipient```` in ````_qv_allocate()```` of ````QVBaseStrategy```` contract
## Summary
The ````voiceCreditsCastToRecipient```` state variable is wrongly updated by ````_qv_allocate()```` function, the votes accounting system of ````QVBaseStrategy```` based contracts would get messed up.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises on L529,  ````=```` rather than ````+=```` should be used here.
