# Missing access control on ````setPoolActive()```` of ````RFPSimpleStrategy````
## Summary
The ````setPoolActive()```` function of ````RFPSimpleStrategy````  contract is missing ````onlyPoolManager```` modifier, it would cause series of proplems, such as front running pool manager's ````distribute()```` call to keep pool always ````active```` and block fund distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail
As the comment on L217, the ````msg.sender```` must be a pool manager.
```solidity
File: contracts\strategies\rfp-simple\RFPSimpleStrategy.sol
216:     /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
217:     /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
218:     /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
219:     function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external { // @audit only pool manager
220:         _setPoolActive(_flag);
221:         emit PoolActive(_flag);
222:     }
```



## Impact
All pool status related functions are affected, such as ````_registerRecipient()````, ````_allocate()```` and ````_distribute()````.
