# An allocator can allocate his votes indefinitely which breaks the purpose of quadratic voting
`QVSimpleStrategy.sol` contract provides a version of a quadratic voting strategy. An authorized allocator is given the permission to allocate his voice credits up to the `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`. The issue is that the contract do not store how many voice credits have been already allocated by the allocator, allowing to allocate voice credits indefinitely.
## Vulnerability Detail
`QVSimpleStrategy.sol` inherits from `QVBaseStrategy.sol` contract. The former has an `_allocate()` function, in which there is a check whether an allocator has any voice credits left
```solidity
if (
            !_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(
                voiceCreditsToAllocate,
                allocator.voiceCredits
            )
        ) revert INVALID();
```
```solidity
function _hasVoiceCreditsLeft(
        uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate,
        uint256 _allocatedVoiceCredits
    ) internal view override returns (bool) {
        return
            _voiceCreditsToAllocate + _allocatedVoiceCredits <=
            maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator;
    }
```
The latter contract, from which QVSimpleStrategy inherits, has the `_qv_allocate()` function which calculates the vote result and updates every important variable accordingly. However, nowhere it updates the `allocator.voiceCredits`, allowing for indefinite allocation of funds.
## Impact
Breaks the purpose of quadratic voting.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the following line to the `_qv_allocate()` function:
```solidity
_allocator.voiceCredits += _voiceCreditsToAllocate
```
