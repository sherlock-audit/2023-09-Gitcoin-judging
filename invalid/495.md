# Use of Openzeppelin's AccessControl.sol in an upgradeable contract
The Allo.sol contract imported non-upgradeable version of Openzeppelin's AccessControl library

## Vulnerability Detail
The Allo contract is an upgradeable contract. As a result, the contract imported Openzeppelin's upgradeable contracts libraries except for AccessControl.sol.

## Impact
Access control roles can be reset or lost during upgrade.
