# Missing `payable` in `Anchor.execute` function
Missing `payable` in `Anchor.execute` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
In contract `Anchor.sol` , the `execute` function expects to execute arbitrary external call to the target contract with value sent. However, the function is not correctly modified with `payable` . 

## Impact
The execute function will revert. 

Even if the contract has a `receive` function implemented, the deposited ETH can easily be frontrunned by an attacker to steal the deposited ETH.
