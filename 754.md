# RFP Committee strategy doesn't check if a user is registered
## Summary
`_allocate()` in `RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol` doesn't perform a check if a recipient is registered
## Vulnerability Detail
`_allocate()` in `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` performs the check shown below if a user is registered, however, in `RFPCommitteeStrategy.sol` there is no such check which breaks the assumption that a recipient can be only allocated if they are registered. 
```solidity
if (acceptedRecipientId == address(0) || recipient.recipientStatus != Status.Pending) {
    revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(acceptedRecipientId);
}
```
## Impact
Only registered recipients can be allocated assumption is broken, future integrations can suffer from lacking such a check that is otherwise present in the rest of the strategies.
