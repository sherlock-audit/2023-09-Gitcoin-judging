# Executions that require native tokens currently wouldn't get processed

## Summary

As seen from this [line of `execute()`](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/core/Anchor.sol#L78)

```solidity

        (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_data);
```

The target address is being called and it could be called with a value, issue is that the execute function itself is not `payable` which means that all executions that require native tokens would fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary

Note that, [from the docs](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/main/contracts/core/Anchor.md#external-functions), the below has been stated:

> execute: Execute a call to a target address, sending a specified amount of native tokens and data. Only the profile owner can initiate this operation.

Additionally take a look at [Anchor.sol#L64-L84](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/core/Anchor.sol#L64-L84)

```solidity
    /// @notice Execute a call to a target address
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be profile owner
    /// @param _target The target address to call
    /// @param _value The amount of native token to send
    /// @param _data The data to send to the target address
    /// @return Data returned from the target address
    function execute(address _target, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) external returns (bytes memory) {
        // Check if the caller is the owner of the profile and revert if not
        if (!registry.isOwnerOfProfile(profileId, msg.sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();

        // Check if the target address is the zero address and revert if it is
        if (_target == address(0)) revert CALL_FAILED();

        // Call the target address and return the data
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_data);

        // Check if the call was successful and revert if not
        if (!success) revert CALL_FAILED();

        return data;
    }

```

As seen from referenced code... even this line `    /// @param _value The amount of native token to send` has stated a clear intention of having value sent but this wouldn't work due to the lack of `payable`

## Impact

Profile owners wouldn't be able to call target addresses on executions that need them to send native tokens... additionally, since `execute()` is the only function present in the contract there is currently no way to remove any native token that's been transferred into Anchor, except if contracts gets upgraded.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make `execute()` payable

```diff
-    function execute(address _target, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) external returns (bytes memory) {
+    function execute(address _target, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) payable external returns  (bytes memory) {
```
