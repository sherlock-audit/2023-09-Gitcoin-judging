# In QV strategy, a clever allocator can get exponentially-many votes
## Summary

An incorrect calculation in _qv_allocate causes the number of credits cast to a recipient to at least double with every call. This means that anyone willing to spend the gas can give nearly 100% of votes to the candidate of their choice.

There is another bug where `allocator.voiceCredits` is never updated, giving each voter infinitely-many votes. If that bug is fixed, this one will remain, and vice-versa.  Funny enough, this one is actually worse, as it allows reaching insanely-high number of votes with much less gas.

## Vulnerability Detail

1. A QV strategy pool is created. Each allocator is given 11e18 voice credits, including Alice.
2. Alice calls allocate() to give 10e18 voice credits to her favorite candidate
3. Alice calls allocate() again to give 1 voice credit to her favorite candidate.
4. The following code runs. After running it, Alice has only cast `sqrt(10e18+1)` votes, but `allocators[alice].voiceCreditsCastTeRecipient[candidate]` is now 20e18+1.

From https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L517C9-L529C78

```solidity
uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
// ...
uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
// ...
 _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
```

5. Alice calls allocate() again with 1 voice credit. This time, Alice has cast `sqrt(20e18+2)` votes, and afterwards `allocators[alice].voiceCreditsCastTeRecipient[candidate]` is now 40e18+3.

6. Alice continues calling allocate() with 1 credit at a time. Each time, the number of voice credits cast to her candidate doubles, and the number of votes is multiplied by a factor of sqrt(2)

## Impact

The QV voting mechanism becomes meaningless;  anyone willing to spend the gas can give nearly 100% of votes to their favorite candidate.
