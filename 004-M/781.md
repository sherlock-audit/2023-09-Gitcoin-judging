# QVBaseStrategy is not following quadratic voting strategies
 QVBaseStrategy is not following quadratic voting strategies

## Vulnerability Detail
**_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]** represents the total credits an allocator has voted for a recipient. This value is updated every time allocator voted. **totalCredits** on line 521 is the new value, so line 529 should be changed to
**_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] = totalCredits;**

## Impact
The calculation method for "total credits" is incorrect, resulting in QVBaseStrategy not following quadratic voting strategies.
