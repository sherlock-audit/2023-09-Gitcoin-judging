# Users can fund pool without sending fees to the treasury
## Summary
`percentFee` is the percentage that is used to calculate the fee Allo takes from each pool when funded and is deducted when a pool is funded. Anyone can fund the pool using `fundPool()`. But users can avoid paying the percentFee by sending in small amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `fundPool()` allows anyone to fund a pool by passing in the pool Id & the amount to fund.
```solidity
File: Allo.sol

    function fundPool(uint256 _poolId, uint256 _amount) external payable nonReentrant {
        // if amount is 0, revert with 'NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS()' error
        if (_amount == 0) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();

        // Call the internal fundPool() function
        _fundPool(_amount, _poolId, pools[_poolId].strategy);
    }
```
Funding takes place by calling the internal function `_fundPool` & if there is a `percentFee`, the fee is calculated, deducted & sent to the treasury.
But the issue lies in the calculation used to calculate the fee amount to be deducted.

```solidity
File: Allo.sol

        function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        ...........

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;
         ..........
```
Take the following scenario - 
- The `percentFee` for the protocol is set to `1e16` (1%).
- `getFeeDenominator` is always set to `1e18`.
- User calls `fundPool` with 99 DAI.
- feeAmount = (99 * 1e16) / 1e18
                     = 0
-  amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;
   amountAfterFee -= 0;
- Thus no amount is deducted even after having a percent fee & the whole amount is directly sent to the pool.

## Impact
Users can fund pool in small amounts avoiding the fees resulting in loss of funds to the protocol.

## Recommendation
Either revert when the `feeAmount` is 0 OR set a minimum amount to be required when funding a pool based on the current `percentFee`.
