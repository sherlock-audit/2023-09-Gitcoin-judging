# Protocol won't be able to function properly on zkSync Era due to hardcoded native token address
Hardcoded native token address results in the protocol not being able to be used on zkSync era
## Vulnerability Detail
In `Native.sol` the native token is hardcoded:
```javascript
address public constant NATIVE = 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE;
```

The team has stated that this protocol should work on zkSync Era [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L11). However, zkSync Era does not use the address `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE` as native token.

zkSync Era uses: `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000800A` as seen [here](https://explorer.zksync.io/address/0x000000000000000000000000000000000000800A) on their explorer.
This means that the current implementation of the protocol won't be able to function fully on zkSyc Era.

## Impact
 People will not be able to use Allo with the native token on zkSync Era, therefore, this breaks the core functionality of the protocol.

Manual Review
## Recommendation
Consider adding functionality that can set the address of the native token.
