# `batchRegisterRecipeint` is not marked as payable function.
## Summary
ETH cannot be forwarded to `registerRecipient` in `BaseStrategy` as `batchRegisterRecipient` in `Allo` is not marked as payable

## Vulnerability Detail
The `registerRecipient` in `BaseStrategy.sol` is a payable function. In `Allo.sol` contract `batchRegisterRecipient` function which calls the strategy's `registerRecipient`  is not marked as payable. So ETH cannot be send along the call. 

## Impact
Strategies which require ETH in custom hook implementations like _beforeRegisterRecipient and _afterRegisterRecipient will fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Mark `batchRegisterRecipient` as payable similar to `registerRecipient` in `BaseStrategy`. Instead of sending `msg.value` with every call in the loop implement accounting for the ETH sent to `batchRegisterRecipient`
