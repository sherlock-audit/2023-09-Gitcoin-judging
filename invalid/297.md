# pool's active/Inactive state is not enforced in core functions of BaseStrategy.sol
the BaseStrategy contract in BaseStrategy.sol is supposed to have two main states, active and inactive state which is determined by the value in variable `poolActive` [[see link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L37)] but it seems they are not used for important core functions like `allocate`, `increasePoolAmount()` and `registerRecipient()`. These functions should not be callable when pool is inactive. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulns are: 
- it will be possible to deposit more funds into pool when it is inactive via `increasePoolAmount()`. 
- it will be possible to register new rceipients after pool is closed. via `registerRecipient()`.
- it will be possible to allocate or reallocate funds to recipients when pool is inactive. 

These functions are not supposed to be accessible when contract is inactive. New receipients should not be registered when pool is inactive. Funds should not be able to be reallocated when pool is inactive. 

## Impact
Important core functions are not well gated and thus arent in sync with the contracts active/inactive states. They have no restrictions that enforce pool's active or inactive state.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L153C1-L186C6
```solidity
    function increasePoolAmount(uint256 _amount) external override onlyAllo {
        _beforeIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
        poolAmount += _amount;
        _afterIncreasePoolAmount(_amount);
    }


    /// @notice Registers a recipient.
    /// @dev Registers a recipient and returns the ID of the recipient. The encoded '_data' will be determined by the
    ///      strategy implementation. Only 'Allo' contract can call this when it is initialized.
    /// @param _data The data to use to register the recipient
    /// @param _sender The address of the sender
    /// @return recipientId The recipientId
    function registerRecipient(bytes memory _data, address _sender)
        external
        payable
        onlyAllo
        onlyInitialized
        returns (address recipientId)
    {
        _beforeRegisterRecipient(_data, _sender);
        recipientId = _registerRecipient(_data, _sender);
        _afterRegisterRecipient(_data, _sender);
    }


    /// @notice Allocates to a recipient.
    /// @dev The encoded '_data' will be determined by the strategy implementation. Only 'Allo' contract can
    ///      call this when it is initialized.
    /// @param _data The data to use to allocate to the recipient
    /// @param _sender The address of the sender
    function allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) external payable onlyAllo onlyInitialized {
        _beforeAllocate(_data, _sender);
        _allocate(_data, _sender);
        _afterAllocate(_data, _sender);
    }
```
in the functions `allocate`, `increasePoolAmount()` and `registerRecipient()` there is no use of modifier `onlyActivePool` to check the states whether inactive or active. 
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
use the modifier `onlyActivePool` on the functions `allocate`, `increasePoolAmount()` and `registerRecipient()` so they revert when pool is inactive.
