# `RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive()` has no access control
## Summary

Anyone can call `RFPSimpleStrategy.setPoolActive()` and change the pool status.

## Vulnerability Detail

As the @NatSpec says.

> *@dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool.*
> 

#POC 1 

Front-run the pool Manager and always set the pool as active so he never will be able to distribute the pool.

#POC 2

Front-run the pool Manager and always set the pool as inactive so he never will be able to allocate a user.

#POC 3

Front-run user and always set the pool as inactive so he never will be able to register a user.

#POC 4

Front-run the pool Manager and always set the pool as active so he never will be able to withdraw the pool funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `onlyPoolManager` modifier to ensure that only the pool manager will be able to change the pool state.

```diff
  /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
  /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
  /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
- function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
+ function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
      _setPoolActive(_flag);
      emit PoolActive(_flag);
  }
```
