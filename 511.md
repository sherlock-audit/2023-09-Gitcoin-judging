# No access control in setPoolActive function.
## Summary
Anyone can set the pool to active or non-active due to lack of access control in the ```setPoolActive``` function in the  ```RPFSimpleStrategy``` contract where an attacker can frontrun a function call which has the modifiers ```onlyActivePool``` and ```onlyInactivePool``` to cause it to fail.  

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
this function in the ```RPFSimpleStrategy``` can be called by anyone to set the pool to be either active or Inactive which could result in
 * someone frontrunning the function call which has the ```onlyActivePool``` modifiers by setting the pool to Inactive 
 * or setting it to true when functions with ```onlyInactivePool``` modifiers are called to revert the transaction.

## Impact
Every time ```allocate```, ```registerRecipient``` and ```withdraw``` functions are called it can be DoS by a fruntrunner.
In the case of the ```withdraw``` function it can cause the Poolmanager to be unable to withdraw the tokens. 
It will also impact the ```RFPCommitteeStrategy``` contract since it inherit from the ```RPFSimpleStrategy``` contract.
