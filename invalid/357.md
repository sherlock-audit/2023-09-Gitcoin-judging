# Milestone metadata can be modified after distribution

RFP Strategy recipients can reenter upon receiving distribution of milestone payment to re-submit the milestone metadata, resulting in a milestone being paid out with unapproved metadata.

## Vulnerability Detail

`RFPSimpleStrategy._distribute` transfers the milestone payment to the recipient before setting the milestone as accepted and incrementing the upcoming milestone. As a result, if the payment is in ETH, the recipient can reenter and call `submitUpcomingMilestone` to change the accepted milestone which has just been paid out to them to have arbitrary metadata which has not been accepted by the pool manager, permanently storing that milestone with unapproved metadata.

## Impact

Milestone recipients can set unapproved, immutable milestone metadata.

```solidity
// @audit transfers before setting state (reentrancy)
_transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

// Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;

// Increment the upcoming milestone
upcomingMilestone++;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`_distribute` should use the checks-effects-interactions pattern and set the `milestoneStatus` and `upcomingMilestone` prior to transferring funds to the recipient.
