# The `QVSimpleStrategy` permits an allocator to assign an infinite number of voice credits.
## Summary
In the QVSimpleStrategy contract, the allocation phase has an oversight: an allocator can distribute voice credits to recipients without adhering to the maximum limit defined during the contract's initialization. This bypasses intended restrictions and may lead to unintended consequences.


## Vulnerability Detail

In the `QVSimpleStrategy` contract, there's a loophole during the allocation phase. When an allocator assigns voice credits to a recipient, the internal function `_hasVoiceCreditsLeft()` is invoked to ensure the allocator hasn't exceeded their allowed limit set by `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`, which is determined during the contract's initialization.

The catch is, `_hasVoiceCreditsLeft()` only validates the amount being allocated in a single transaction and not the cumulative amount previously allocated by the allocator. This means, by distributing voice credits over multiple transactions in smaller quantities, an allocator can easily surpass the `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` limit. This oversight can potentially be exploited.

## Impact
During the allocation phase in the QVSimpleStrategy contract, allocators can assign unlimited voice credits to recipients. This unchecked behavior allows them to amplify the quadratic rewards for recipients without any bounds.

This oversight has been classified as a high-severity issue, primarily because it deviates significantly from the specifications outlined in the documentation. Such a discrepancy could lead to unintended consequences and potential misuse of the system.

```solidity
maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator (uint256): Maximum voice credits that can be allocated by a single allocator.
_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate, uint256 _allocatedVoiceCredits) internal view override returns (bool): Checks if an allocator has enough voice credits left to allocate.
```

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function testRevert_allocate_unlimitedVoiceCredits_PASS() public {
        address recipientId = __register_accept_recipient();
        address allocator = randomAddress();
        vm.startPrank(pool_manager2());
        qvSimpleStrategy().addAllocator(allocator);
        vm.warp(allocationStartTime + 10);
        assertEq(qvSimpleStrategy().maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator(), 100);

        bytes memory allocateData = __generateAllocation(recipientId, 100);

        vm.stopPrank();
         vm.expectEmit(true,false, false,false);
        emit Allocated(recipientId, 9.949e9, allocator);
        vm.startPrank(address(allo()));
        vm.expectEmit(false,false, false,true);
        emit AllocatorVoiceCreditQVSimple(100,0);
        qvSimpleStrategy().allocate(allocateData, allocator);
        vm.expectEmit(false,false, false,true);
        emit AllocatorVoiceCreditQVSimple(100,0);
        qvSimpleStrategy().allocate(allocateData, allocator);
      
    }
```

## Recommendation

In the `QVSimpleStrategy` contract, to keep a record of the total voice credits allocated by each allocator, it's crucial to increment the respective allocator's `voiceCredits` after a successful allocation. This helps ensure accurate tracking and enforces limits.

The suggested update would be:

```solidity
function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal virtual override {
        (address recipientId, uint256 voiceCreditsToAllocate) = abi.decode(_data, (address, uint256));

        // spin up the structs in storage for updating
        Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
        Allocator storage allocator = allocators[_sender];

        // check that the sender can allocate votes
        if (!_isValidAllocator(_sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();

        // check that the recipient is accepted
        if (!_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId)) revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);

        // check that the recipient has voice credits left to allocate
        console.log("_allocate::allocator.voiceCredits=",allocator.voiceCredits);
        if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();

        _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
        //@audit: Increment the allocator's voice credits
       allocator.voiceCredits += voiceCreditsToAllocate;
    }
