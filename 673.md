# `RFPCommitteeStrategy#_allocate` The committee's voting object should be a complete proposal. If the proposal is updated, the votes should be invalidated, otherwise the committee's voting mechanism will be ineffective.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

Sophisticated recipients can exploit the voting mechanism by:

- Creating `_recipients[recipientId]` with a very low `proposalBid`.
- When `votes[recipientId]` is about to reach the `voteThreshold`, use `registerRecipient()` to increase `_recipients[recipientId].proposalBid`.
- At this point, `votes[recipientId]` will have a significant advantage over other `votes[i]`.
