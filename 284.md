# the of voiceCredits not record lead to a single allocator could allocate an unlimited amount of voice credits
## Summary
the of voiceCredits not record lead to a single allocator could allocate an unlimited amount of voice credits

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L107#L124

while initializing contract we set the maximum voice credits per allocator to `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` , and  check whether it exceeds the limit via `_hasVoiceCreditsLeft` function. But the value of `allocator.voiceCredits`  not record  which lead to single allocator  can't exceeds  the limit of `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator` in single transactino . Howerer allocator can make multiple transactions lead t o bypass the limit 

this is test case:

```solidity
    function testAllocate() public {
        address recipientId = __register_accept_recipient();
        address allocator = randomAddress();

        vm.startPrank(pool_manager2());
        vm.warp(allocationStartTime + 10);

        qvSimpleStrategy().addAllocator(allocator);


        vm.stopPrank();
        bytes memory allocateData = __generateAllocation(recipientId, maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator);

        vm.startPrank(address(allo()));

        qvSimpleStrategy().allocate(allocateData, allocator);
        qvSimpleStrategy().allocate(allocateData, allocator);
}
```

Note that each transaction we use maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator.

## Impact
allocator could allocate an unlimited amount of voice credits
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal virtual override {
        (address recipientId, uint256 voiceCreditsToAllocate) = abi.decode(_data, (address, uint256));

        // spin up the structs in storage for updating
        Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
        Allocator storage allocator = allocators[_sender];

        // check that the sender can allocate votes
        if (!_isValidAllocator(_sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();

        // check that the recipient is accepted
        if (!_isAcceptedRecipient(recipientId)) revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);

        // check that the recipient has voice credits left to allocate
        if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();  //@audit <---------not record value.

        _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
we should record the value of allocator.voiceCredits after successfully allocate
