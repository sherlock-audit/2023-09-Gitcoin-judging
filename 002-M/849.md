# Allo.sol#_fundPool
The amount with which a user funds the pool is not calculated correctly when using fee-on-transfer tokens. According to the contest details they are in scope. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's see the code of the `_fundPool` function:
```solidity
    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```
As you can see we're increasing the balance of the pool here:
```solidity
_strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);
```
However, the balance won't be increased with the right amount as after the transfer, a fee will be charged if using fee-on-transfer tokens. 
## Impact
The internal accounting of the pool will be wrong leading to accounting issues when withdrawing, adding funds, etc. Potentially leading to someone not being able to receive all of the funds they have on paper.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the balance before and after the transfer to see the exact amount of tokens that were transferred:
```solidity
        uint256 balanceBefore = _token.balanceOf(address(_strategy));
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        uint256 amountToAdd = _token.balanceOf(address(_strategy)); - balanceBefore;
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountToAdd);
```
