# Pool can't be created when user provided correct payment
Pool can't be created when user provided correct payment because of wrong comparison.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user creates pool he should provide baseFee as msg.value.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L469-L478
```solidity
        if (baseFee > 0) {
            // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
            // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
            // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
            _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
            emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
        }
```
As you can see in case if user provides just `baseFee + _amount` fo native payment or just `baseFee` then transaction will revert.
## Impact
User who provides right amount of funds can't create pool.

## Recommendation
Use this.
```solidity
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
            }
```
