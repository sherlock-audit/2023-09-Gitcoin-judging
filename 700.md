# Wrong check in RFPSimpleStrategy#submitUpcomingMilestone
## Summary

Wrong check in RFPSimpleStrategy#submitUpcomingMilestone

## Vulnerability Detail

Comment in the `submitUpcomingMilestone` function states that function should be allowed to call only by the address that is `acceptedRecipientId` AND member of the Profile:
```solidity
        // Check if the 'msg.sender' is the 'acceptedRecipientId' and is a member of the 'Profile'
        if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender && !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)) {
            revert UNAUTHORIZED();
        }
```

However, due to the `&&` operator in the `if` condition - an address that is `acceptedRecipientId` OR a member of the Profile would be allowed to call the `submitUpcomingMilestone` function.

## Impact

Only accepted recipients who are also profile members should be allowed to submit milestones. However, currently, any profile member can submit them.

```solidity
File: RFPSimpleStrategy.sol
249:     /// @notice Submit milestone by the acceptedRecipientId.
250:     /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be the 'acceptedRecipientId' and must be a member
251:     ///      of a 'Profile' to sumbit a milestone. Emits a 'MilestonesSubmitted()' event.
252:     /// @param _metadata The proof of work
253:     function submitUpcomingMilestone(Metadata calldata _metadata) external {
254:         // Check if the 'msg.sender' is the 'acceptedRecipientId' and is a member of the 'Profile'
255:         if (acceptedRecipientId != msg.sender && !_isProfileMember(acceptedRecipientId, msg.sender)) { 
256:             revert UNAUTHORIZED();
257:         }
...
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider updating the `if` condition operator from `&&` to `||` in the RFPSimpleStrategy#submitUpcomingMilestone function.
