# Missing access control on `setPoolActive`
No access control on `setPoolActive`
## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can toggle the status of a pool from active to inactive, this function is meant to be called by a pool manager but it's missing an access control.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L219
```solidity
/// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
You can also see that it inherits from [BaseStrategy._setPoolActive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/BaseStrategy.sol#L276) which provides no access control.
```solidity
function _setPoolActive(bool _active) internal {
        poolActive = _active;
        emit PoolActive(_active);
    }
```

## Impact
Anyone could brick any functionalities that depends on the active state of the pool.
