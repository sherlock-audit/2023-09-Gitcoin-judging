# Distribution not possible in some cases
Distributing is not working in some cases because milestone percentage is not taken into consideration when checking if the pool has enough funds for the distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail
In **RFPSimpleStrategy**, the [_distribute](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L417-L450) function calculates the amount to be distributed based on a milestone percentage and proposalBid. The function checks if the pool has enough funds to execute the distribution. However, the [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L432) is wrong. 

It checks the whole proposalBid, not taking the milestone percentage into consideration. This is problematic for cases where the **proposalBid** is higher than the **poolAmount**, but the final payout is smaller than the **poolAmount**.

Imagine the following scenario: 
 1. The pool has 1000 tokens.
 2. Distribution should happen at 2 milestones (80% and 20%)
 3. Bob the recipient has **proposalBid** 800
 4. At the first milestone 800 < 1000 (proposalBid < poolAmount), so the distribution will be successfull.
 5. At the second milestone 800 > 360 (proposalBid > poolAmount), the distribution will fail, even though the poolAmount is 360 and the amount for distribution at the milestone is 160.

## Impact
Distribution will not work.

## Code Snippet
```jsx
    function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {
        // check to make sure there is a pending milestone
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

        IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        Recipient memory recipient = _recipients[acceptedRecipientId];

        // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
        if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();

        // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
        uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;

        // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
        poolAmount -= amount;
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

        // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;

        // Increment the upcoming milestone
        upcomingMilestone++;

        // Emit events for the milestone and the distribution
        emit MilestoneStatusChanged(upcomingMilestone, Status.Accepted);
        emit Distributed(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the if statement. The contract uses solidity version **0.8.19**, so the compiler will do the needed check for us.
