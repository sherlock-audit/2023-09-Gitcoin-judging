# Anybody can set the pool status of the RFPSimpleStrstegy contract

Lack of permissions on `_setPoolActive` allows anybody to set the pool status to false which can prevent the `RFPSimplyStrategy` from accepting more proposals. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `RFPSimpleStrategy` contract inherits the `_setPoolActive` function from the `BaseStrategy` contract. This allows the pool to determine whether it is currently accepting proposals or not through the `onlyActivePool` modifier however, even though the natspec states that `msg.sender` must be a pool manager to close the pool, anybody can call this function.

## Impact

A malicious user can manipulate the natural flow of the pool to prevent or keep accepting recipients as well as denying the selection of an RFP allocation whenever it seems profitable to them. 

The following proof of concept can be inserted at the foot of RFPSimpleStrategy.t.sol which should revert but doesn’t: 

```solidity
 		address attacker = vm.addr(9);

    function testSetPoolStatus() public {

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        strategy.setPoolActive(false);
        vm.stopPrank();
        
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It’s recommended that setPoolActive is guarded by a modifier or a check to ensure that the msg.sender is a pool manager.
