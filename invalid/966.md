# `_allocate` won't work as intended
The code contains a vulnerability where if a user sends even 1 wei more than the required amount, the function will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is a conditional statement that checks if the user is sending ether and the token is not the native token, or if the token is the native token and the value sent is not equal to the required amount. If either of these conditions is true, the function will revert.
```solidity
// If the token is native, the amount must be equal to the value sent, otherwise it reverts
        if (msg.value > 0 && token != NATIVE || token == NATIVE && msg.value != amount) { //@audit it is very hard to send exact amount
            revert INVALID();
        }
```

## Impact
This vulnerability means that even a slight deviation from the exact required amount, such as sending 1 wei more than required, will result in the function reverting. This could lead to inconvenience for users who unintentionally send a slightly higher amount.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify as follow and then refund the dust amount
```solidity
// If the token is native, the amount must be equal to the value sent, otherwise it reverts
        if (msg.value > 0 && token != NATIVE || token == NATIVE && msg.value < amount) { 
            revert INVALID();
        }
```
