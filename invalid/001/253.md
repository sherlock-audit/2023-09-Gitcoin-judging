# `percentFee` can be avoided.
## Summary
Pools can be established and funded without being subjected to the protocol's `percentFee`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `createPool()` function, `_createPool()` is called, allowing `_amount` to be set to 0. After the pool is created, the Pool deployer can utilize `fundPool()`. The `_fundPool()` function is then executed, which contains the following logic:
```solidity
    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;

        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```
The issue arises when the pool deployer can repeatedly use `fundPool()` with a minimal `_amount` parameter, resulting in `feeAmount` equal to 0 after calculating the `percentFee`. Consequently, no fees are directed to the `treasury`. This exploit can be particularly effective on layer 2 networks with low gas fees.

## Impact
The bug enables the pool deployer to achieve the same pool details without incurring any fees.

## Recommendation
```solidity
        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
+           require(feeAmount != 0);
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }
```
