# Anyone can toggle the status of a pool
## Summary

Anyone can toggle the status of a pool between active and inactive which is not intended design since `msg.sender` must be a pool manager to close the pool as stated in this [line](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L217)

The analyzed smart contract functions, `setPoolActive` and `withdraw`, may contain vulnerabilities. The primary concern revolves around unrestricted access to the `setPoolActive` function, which can compromise the protocol's intended functionalities and behaviours.

## Vulnerability Detail

See summary

Additionally, key to note that a few functions of the strategy either requires the pool to be active or inactive before they get executed which means that someone could actively grief the protocol by front-running calls that require the pool to be inactive with setting the pools active or vice versa

Take the [withdrawal process](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L292-L301) as an example:

```solidity
    /// @notice Withdraw funds from pool.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to withdraw funds.
    /// @param _amount The amount to be withdrawn
function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) onlyInactivePool {
    poolAmount -= _amount;
    _transferAmount(allo.getPool(poolId).token, msg.sender, _amount);
}
```

As seen it requires that the pool to be inactive before any withdrawals are procesed from pool.

Now take a look at [RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L216-L222](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/rfp-simple/RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#L216-L222)

```solidity
    /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
    _setPoolActive(_flag);
    emit PoolActive(_flag);
}
```

As seen, though the comments above the function clearly states that only the pool manager should be able to set this flag, in code implementation no restrictions are applied and as such any one could access and in the case of withdrawals a user could just front-runs pool manager's attempt to withdraw with setting the pool active and the withdrawal reverts... obviously other windows could be explored on the lack of access control while setting the pool's activity flag, but the root cause is the lack of access control.

## Impact

- Contract does not follow important logic, since restrictions are not placed on crucial functions
- The pool managers might be restricted from managing and withdrawing funds as intended.
- In some cases malicious actors could brick the protocol by frontrunning calls, leading to fund lockup and disruption of intended functionalities.

## Recommendation

Correctly follow docs and apply the required access control, i.e in this case prefix _"onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)"_ to the `setPoolActive()` function
