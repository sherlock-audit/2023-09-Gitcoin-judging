# Invalid qv_allocate allows allocators to give unlimited votes to a recipient
## Summary
`qv_allocate` doesn't properly update recipients vote credits allowing allocators to prop up their favorite recipients

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        if (_voiceCreditsToAllocate == 0) revert INVALID();

        // get the previous values
        uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
        uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId];

        // get the total credits and calculate the vote result
        uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient; // this is total credits of a recipient
        uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);

        // update the values
        voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
        totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
        _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;

        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits; // should be '=' or '+=' creditsCastToRecipient
        _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;

        // emit the event with the vote results
        emit Allocated(_recipientId, voteResult, _sender);
```

As we can `voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` is not updated properly. It essentially doubles with every vote and an allocator might benefit from it.



Furthermore, `voiceCredits` is not updated for an allocator which makes this check essentially useless:

```solidity
if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();
```

```solidity
    function _hasVoiceCreditsLeft(uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate, uint256 _allocatedVoiceCredits)
        internal
        view
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        return _voiceCreditsToAllocate + _allocatedVoiceCredits <= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator;
    }
```

## Impact

Incorrect votes accounting resulting in rigged funds distribution.

## Recommendation

```diff
-    _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
+    _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += creditsCastToRecipient; 
+    _allocator.voiceCredits += creditsCastToRecipient;
