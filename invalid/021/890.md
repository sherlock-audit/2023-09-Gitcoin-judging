# On pool creation user need to provide `msg.value` more than required `baseFee`, but the rest of `msg.value` is not refunded back to user, (it will be kept in Allo)
## Summary

User need to provide `msg.value` more than required `baseFee` when creating a pool, then the rest of `msg.value` is kept on Allo contract, not refunded back to user

## Vulnerability Detail

Allo charges some fee for pool creation, the amount to provide is the `baseFee`.

```js
File: Allo.sol
50:     /// @notice Fee Allo charges for all pools on creation
51:     /// @dev This is different from the 'percentFee' in that this is a flat fee and not a percentage. So if you want to create a pool
52:     ///      with a base fee of 100 DAI, then you would pass 100 DAI to the 'createPool()' function and the pool would be created
53:     ///      with 100 DAI less than the amount you passed to the function. The base fee is sent to the treasury address.
54:     uint256 internal baseFee;
```

When user creates a pool, via `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` or `createPool`, it will call internal function `_createPool`. Inside this internal function there is this following snippet.

```js
File: Allo.sol
469:         if (baseFee > 0) {
470:             // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
471:             // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
472:             // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
473:             if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
474:                 revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
475:             }
476:             _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);
477:             emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
478:         }
```

This snippet means, when the `baseFee` > 0, then there will be a check to make sure user provide a required `baseFee`. According to the code, this `baseFee` is nominated as NATIVE token.

The issue here is, this part of code.

```js
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
    revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
}
```

the `>=` sign or `greater than or equal to` raise an issue here.

with this sign, it means, user need to provide `msg.value` greater than `baseFee`, because if `msg.value` equal `baseFee` then the transaction will be reverted, due to the equal sign in ">=" operator.

This might not align with the common behaviour. If the intention is to allow transactions with exactly the required `baseFee`, then the condition should be modified to use > instead of >=.

This issue is a High one, because with current code (for example, assuming `_token` is not NATIVE) when user try to create a pool, they need to provide `msg.value` greater than `baseFee`, the `baseFee` amount then transferred to treasury, the rest of it will stay in Allo contract instead of refunded back to the user, thus user will loss their asset.

## Impact

User need to provide baseFee amount more than required, and the rest of required baseFee amount will be kept by Allo contract instead of refunding it to user.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

the condition check should be modified to use > instead of >=, for example

```js
if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)) {
    revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
}
```
