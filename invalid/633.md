# An attacker/MEV bot can DOS creating pool in `Allo.sol`
Attacker/MEV can front run the `createPool` function to deploy the `strategy` contract to cause DOS for the user who wanted to create the pool
## Vulnerability Detail
The strategy contract creation process is defined as follows: `IStrategy(Clone.createClone(_strategy, _nonces[msg.sender]++))`. This process invokes the `ClonesUpgradeable.cloneDeterministic(_contract, salt)` function, which employs the create2 opcode and a designated `salt` value to facilitate the deterministic deployment of a clone contract. It is crucial to note that utilizing the same `implementation` and `salt` combination multiple times will result in a transaction reversal, as clones cannot be deployed repeatedly at identical addresses. 

However, a potential security vulnerability emerges when an attacker opportunistically front-runs a user's transaction with the intent to create a strategy contract using the same `implementation` and `salt`. Consequently, when the user initiates the transaction to deploy the strategy contract, it will encounter a revert operation. The `salt` value in this context is computed as follows: `bytes32 salt = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, _nonce))`. It is essential to recognize that an attacker can readily replicate this process to supply the function with an identical `salt` value, thereby protocol will be DOS'ed.
## Impact
Users can't able to create pools

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To enhance the security of the deployment process and mitigate the risk of front-running, you can implement a mechanism that pre-predicts the address of the strategy contract using the `predictDeterministicAddress` function. If the contract is already deployed at that predicted address, it returns the existing address; otherwise, it deploys the contract and returns the newly created address.
