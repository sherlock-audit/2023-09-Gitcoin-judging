# Missing `if` statement on `registryAnchor != address(0)`
## Summary
The code contains a missing `if` tatement to validate the `registryAnchor` address before its usage.
## Vulnerability Detail
The code lacks an `if` statement to check the validity of the `registryAnchor` address before assigning it to `recipientId`.
## Impact
The absence of this validation can result in unexpected behaviour or errors if `registryAnchor`is uninitialized or set to an invalid address.

## Recommendation
It is recommended to include an `if` statement to validate the `registryAnchor` address before using it. This will help prevent potential issues and ensure proper address handling in the code.
