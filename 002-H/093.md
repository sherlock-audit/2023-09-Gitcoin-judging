# Missing access control on the setPoolActive function
## Summary
Access control is missed on the `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol.setPoolActive` function and anyone can call this function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `setPoolActive` function from `RFPSimpleStrategy` contract is used in order to toggle the status between active and inactive.

```solidity
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```

```solidity
    function _setPoolActive(bool _active) internal {
        poolActive = _active;
        emit PoolActive(_active);
    }

```
The problem is that based on the comment from team, only `pool manager` should be able to call this function. But as you can see, there is no access control over this function and anyone can call it.

## Impact
Anyone can call this function and toggle the status of the pool between active and inactive.
