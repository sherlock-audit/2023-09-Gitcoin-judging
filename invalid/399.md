# The batch functions will not work if a strategy requires native currency
## Summary
[batchRegisterRecipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L313-L333) and [batchAllocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L362-L375) are both batch function that call either the strategy or another internal function. However they both lack payable, which means it is impossible to send `msg.value` with them, and if the strategy requires native currency as like a few, these functions will be unusable.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
Unlike [allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L352-L354) which **is payable**,[batchAllocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L362-L375) **is not**. However they both call the internal function  [_allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L492-L494) which allocates to the given strategy. Same is true for the payable [registerRecipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L301-L304) and not payable - [batchRegisterRecipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L313-L333).

If a strategy has some native fee (like ARB on L2) these batch function will not be usable for this strategy. Which is no good since, a part of the contract becomes obsolete or sometimes works and sometimes it does not.

## Impact
Some function may be unusable with most of the strategies. A part of the contract becomes obsolete. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function registerRecipient(uint256 _poolId, bytes memory _data) 
        external 
        payable // <= has payable 
        nonReentrant
        returns (address);

    function batchRegisterRecipient(uint256[] memory _poolIds, bytes[] memory _data)
        external
        nonReentrant // <= payable is missing
        returns (address[] memory recipientIds);
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding payable to the batch function. This will make them usable with custom strategies.
