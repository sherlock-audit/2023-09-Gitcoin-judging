# wrong check when checking the base fee
in **Allo.sol** when creating a pool if the base fee is check  wrongly which will lead to revert even if the creator paid the exact base fee amount
## Vulnerability Detail
in **Allo.so**l when creating a pool if the base fee is  assigned you need to pay the base fee when creating a pool and  in the internal function  **_createPool** there is a check which verify if the pool creator has sent enough base fee but when checking the code uses **>=** which will revert even  if the pool creator  have sent only the required **basefee** which means the user have to sent more than the base fee in order to create a pool
`            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
`
## Impact
unnecessary cost for pool creator
