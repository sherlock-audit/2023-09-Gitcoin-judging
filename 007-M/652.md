# A pool manager can vote multiple times, which could jeopardize the Recipients Review Process.

## Vulnerability Detail

Per the docs: https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/qv-base/README.md

> `reviewThreshold` (uint256, slot 1): ==The number of votes required== to review a recipient.

> Recipients Review Process
    
    * Pool managers can review recipient applications and update their statuses.
    * Depending on the review threshold, recipients' statuses can change from pending to accepted or rejected.
    * If the review threshold is met, recipient statuses are updated, allowing them to participate in voting or receive payouts.

However, in the current implementation:

-   The same pool manager can vote repeatedly.
-   Votes with different recipientStatus for the same recipientId can overwrite each other.
    -   `recipient.recipientStatus` can change from Pending to Accepted, then to Rejected, then back to Pending, and so on.

## Recommendation

Record the voter in storage, and each pool manager can only vote once.
