# Supported tokens can be trapped in all strategy contracts forever
## Summary

As per the documentation, Allo V2 is intended to "support all ERC20 tokens", as projects should be able to pay out whatever token best suits their need. This includes rebasing tokens, such as stETH and others. The issue is that, assuming these tokens rebase upwards (now a larger balance), that extra supply is now trapped in the strategy contract being used (issue applied to all implementations). Even contracts with `withdraw` functions will not be able to send this excess amount, as they can only send up to `poolAmount`, which represents the initial amount deposited (prior to rebase).

## Vulnerability Detail

Firstly, there is no `withdraw` function in the QVSimpleStrategy contract, meaning any excess tokens (due to rebasing) will be completely stuck.

However, let's also consider the `withdraw` function implementation for the RFPSimpleStrategy which is defined as follows:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) onlyInactivePool {
    // Decrement the pool amount
    poolAmount -= _amount;

    // Transfer the amount to the pool manager
    _transferAmount(allo.getPool(poolId).token, msg.sender, _amount);
}
```

Since the `poolAmount` is equal to the initial value of the rebasing token when it was first deposited (see the `increasePoolAmount` function in BaseStrategy), it will be impossible to withdraw any of the extra rebasing amount. This means that those tokens will be forever locked inside this contract.

## Impact

Supported tokens such as rebasing tokens (stETH, etc.) can be trapped forever inside the strategy contracts, meaning a direct loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

All strategy contracts (MerkleDistribution, QV, RFP) should support a `withdraw` function which can send the entire balance of a token, rather than relying on the stored `poolAmount` value.
