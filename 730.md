# Missing access modifier for the setPoolActive function.
## Summary

The function ```setPoolActive()``` is an external function which should only be accessible by the pool manager to open and close the pool according to the docs. However, the ```onlyPoolManager``` modifier is missing.

## Vulnerability Detail
This means that anyone can set the pool's active status to open or closed very easily.

## Impact
This means all functions that require the pool to be active can stop working forever, if a bad actor wishes to keep closing the pool. This includes the ```_registerRecipient``` and ```_allocate``` functions to stop working in RFPSimpleStrategy.sol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Since the msg.sender must be a pool manager, adjust the function declaration from ```function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external```
to ```function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)```.
