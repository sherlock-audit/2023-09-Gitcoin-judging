# Anyone can set pool active or not active in `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` as it lacks proper checks.
The `setPoolActive(bool _flag)` function in `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` is an external function which changes the state of the pool to active or non-active according to the `_flag` provided and its Natspec clearly states that it will only be called by `poolManager`  but it lacks proper checks to validate the caller. 

## Vulnerability Detail
`setPoolActive(bool _flag)` doesn't include the modifier `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` to properly validate the caller as included in other functions which require only pool Manager to call it. 

## Impact
- Anyone can set pool to active or non active which will lead to unexpected behaviors. 
- Attacker can front-run this function every time someone interacts with this pool which will make users interaction revert.

```solidity
   function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Include modifier `onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)` 
```solidity
function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
