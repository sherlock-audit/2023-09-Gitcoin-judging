# RFPSimpleStrategy#setPoolActive
The function `setPoolActive()` in RFPSimpleStrategy lacks access control, letting anyone toggle the pool between active and inactive, bricking important functionality in the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's see the code of the function:
```solidity
    /// @notice Toggle the status between active and inactive.
    /// @dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event.
    /// @param _flag The flag to set the pool to active or inactive
    function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
        _setPoolActive(_flag);
        emit PoolActive(_flag);
    }
```
There is no access control but the comment states `@dev 'msg.sender' must be a pool manager to close the pool. Emits a 'PoolActive()' event`. The internal function `_setPoolActive()` that we inherit from BaseStrategy.sol doesn't have an additional check either:
```solidity
    function _setPoolActive(bool _active) internal {
        poolActive = _active;
        emit PoolActive(_active);
    }
```
## Impact
A malicious user can continuously front-run the pool manager setting the pool to active/inactive and essentially bricking the most important functions in the contract that depend on the pool being active/inactive:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) onlyInactivePool
```
```solidity
function _registerRecipient(bytes memory _data, address _sender) internal override onlyActivePool
```
```solidity
function _allocate(bytes memory _data, address _sender)internal virtual override nonReentrant onlyActivePool onlyPoolManager(_sender)
```
```solidity
function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender) internal virtual override onlyInactivePool onlyPoolManager(_sender)
```

## Recommendation
Add access control as stated in the comment:
```solidity
function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {}
```
