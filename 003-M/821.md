# `allocator.voiceCerdits` is not used in `QVSimpleStrategy` which the alloactor can vote unlimited times
`allocator.voiceCredits` is not updated to check how many credits the allocator has used so they can cast more votes than the `maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator`
## Vulnerability Detail
`allocator.voiceCredits` is not updated in `_qv_allocate` 
ex:
max=10
The allocator calls `_qv_allocate` 10 times getting 10 votes each call 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L506
as you can see in this function there is no setting of `allocator.voiceCredits`
## Impact
Breaks the core invariant that max is the most the allocator can vote and so when allocation ends the recipient chosen will end up with more votes getting more funds 
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L121
```solidity
// @auditor the check 
     if (!_hasVoiceCreditsLeft(voiceCreditsToAllocate, allocator.voiceCredits)) revert INVALID();

        _qv_allocate(allocator, recipient, recipientId, voiceCreditsToAllocate, _sender);
    }
// _hasVoiceCreditsLeft
   function _hasVoiceCreditsLeft(uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate, uint256 _allocatedVoiceCredits)
        return _voiceCreditsToAllocate + _allocatedVoiceCredits <= maxVoiceCreditsPerAllocator;
    }
```
the test and just set the max to 10 in the setUp and the test will pass 
```solidity
function test_allocate_reverts() public virtual {
    address allocator = randomAddress();
    address recipientId= __register_accept_allocate_recipient();
    vm.startPrank(pool_manager2());
    vm.warp(allocationStartTime+10);
    bytes memory allocateData = __generateAllocation(recipientId, 10);
    vm.stopPrank();
    vm.startPrank(address(allo()));
    bytes memory allocateData2= __generateAllocation(recipientId,10);
    qvStrategy().allocate(allocateData, allocator);
    qvStrategy().allocate(allocateData2,allocator);
}

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
set it to the number of votesCredits the allocator set 
```solidity
allocator.voiceCredits+= voiceCreditsToAllocate
```
