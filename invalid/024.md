# Missing timelock mechanism
The smart contract lacks a time-lock mechanism for the `recoverFunds` function. This vulnerability allows the owner to withdraw all funds from the protocol without any delay or oversight. It is recommended to implement a time-lock mechanism to prevent potential misuse by the owner, especially in situations where the admin privileges may be deprecated.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the absence of a time-lock mechanism on the `recoverFunds` function. As it stands, the owner can execute this function at any time, transferring all funds from the contract to a specified recipient address without any delay or additional authorization.
## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability is significant, as it grants the owner unrestricted access to drain all funds from the protocol. This could result in a loss of funds for other participants or users of the protocol if the owner decides to abuse their privileges.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is strongly recommended to enhance the security of the smart contract by implementing a time-lock mechanism for the recoverFunds function. This time-lock mechanism should introduce a delay between the request to execute this function and its actual execution, during which time other stakeholders or administrators can review and potentially veto the withdrawal. By adding such a safeguard, you can prevent the owner from unilaterally draining funds and add an additional layer of security to the protocol. Additionally, consider reviewing and potentially updating the admin privileges and access control to reduce the risk associated with deprecated admin roles.
