# RFPSimpleStrategy's _distribute implementation is incorrect
## Summary
RFPSimpleStrategy cannot distribute a portion of the fund because the proposalBid comparison syntax in _distribute is incorrect.
## Vulnerability Detail

User can receive a portion of the fund when the recipient achieves a milestone.

```solidity
function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {
        // check to make sure there is a pending milestone
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

        IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        Recipient memory recipient = _recipients[acceptedRecipientId];

        // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
        if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS(); //@audit <==

        // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
        uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;

        // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
        poolAmount -= amount;
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

        // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;

        // Increment the upcoming milestone
        upcomingMilestone++;

        // Emit events for the milestone and the distribution
        emit MilestoneStatusChanged(upcomingMilestone, Status.Accepted);
        emit Distributed(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
    }
```
The `if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();` syntax in `_distribute` compares `proposalBid`, the total reward to be received, to `poolAmount`, and requires that poolAmount be greater to pass.

As the recipient achieves milestones, the `poolAmount` is reduced by `poolAmount -= amount;`.

Therefore, you shouldn't compare the gradually decreasing `poolAmount` to the fixed value of `proposalBid`.

When the latter milestone is achieved, `NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS` will occur because the `poolAmount` is reduced by the rewarded amount, but the `proposalBid` remains at its initial value.

## Impact
The recipient does not receive the full amount promised.

## Recommendation
Decrease recipient.proposalBid by the amount of the reward paid.
