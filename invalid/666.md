# There is no limit on the amount of fees users have to pay

The Allo contract allows for the protocol to set percentage and base fees however, there is no bound when these fees are being processed.

## Vulnerability Detail

The _updatePrecentFee and _updateBaseFee functions in the Allo.sol contract are used to set the fees for the protocol. When the a user attempts to fund the pool, the fees are calculated and transferred from the msg.sender to the treasury however, these functions only check that the fee percentage does not exceed 100%.

## Impact

In the event the protocol acts maliciously, they can secretly set the fees to 1e18 which is equal to 100% of the total price.
