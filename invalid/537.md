# Pool funds can be locked permanently in QVBaseStrategy and QVSimpleStrategy
Unlike other strategy contracts, `QVBaseStrategy.sol` and `QVSimpleStrategy.sol` don't have a `withdraw()` function to allow the pool manager to recover funds after distribution. This leaves no methods to transfer the remaining funds out of the strategy contract, causing a permanent loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
Notice in all other strategy contracts in scope, an external access-controlled `withdraw()` function is implemented to allow pool manager to take the remaining funds out after fund distribution. See an example below from `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol`.

```solidity
//DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol
    /// @notice Withdraw funds from pool
    /// @dev This can only be called after the allocation has ended and 30 days have passed. If the
    ///      '_amount' is greater than the pool amount or if 'msg.sender' is not a pool manager.
    /// @param _amount The amount to be withdrawn
    function withdraw(uint256 _amount) external onlyPoolManager(msg.sender) {
        if (block.timestamp <= allocationEndTime + 30 days) {
            revert INVALID();
        }

        IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);

        if (_amount > poolAmount) {
            revert INVALID();
        }

        poolAmount -= _amount;

        // Transfer the tokens to the 'msg.sender' (pool manager calling function)
        _transferAmount(pool.token, msg.sender, _amount);
    }
```
However, similar `withdraw()` is not implemented in `QVBaseStrategy.sol` and `QVSimpleStrategy.sol`. 

In addition, QVBaseStrategy and QVSimpleStrategy implements a payout pattern for fund distribution that will in normal circumstance result in remaining fund post distribution. This is because `_getPayout()` will calculate amount of payout based on a percentage of votes a recipient received. This increases the chances for funds to be left in the pool. This is on top of the fact that a pool can funded independently from Allo.sol at any given time. In combination, i consider it a high chance funds will be locked in the pool post-distribution indefinitely.

```solidity
//QVBaseStrategy.sol
    function _getPayout(address _recipientId, bytes memory)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        override
        returns (PayoutSummary memory)
    {
        Recipient memory recipient = recipients[_recipientId];

        // Calculate the payout amount based on the percentage of total votes
        uint256 amount;
        if (!paidOut[_recipientId] && totalRecipientVotes != 0) {
            amount = poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;
        }
        return PayoutSummary(recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
    }
```

## Impact
Pool funds can be locked permanently in both QVBaseStrategy and QVSimpleStrategy.
