# QV strategy wrong `voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` update calculations
The update calculation for `voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` inside `_qv_allocate(...)` is wrong.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `_qv_allocate(..., uint256 voiceCreditsToAllocate, ...)` the variable `totalCredits = voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient` is the sum of the already delegated voice credits to the recipient and the new voice credits to be further allocated. The issue is that later in the function we have `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;` which increments the allocators casted credits with his new and old casted voice credits (rather only with the new). 
```solidity
function _qv_allocate(
        Allocator storage _allocator,
        Recipient storage _recipient,
        address _recipientId,
        uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate,
        address _sender
    ) internal onlyActiveAllocation {
        // check the `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` is > 0
        if (_voiceCreditsToAllocate == 0) revert INVALID();

        // get the previous values
        uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
        uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId];

        // get the total credits and calculate the vote result
        uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
        // code ...

        // @audit wrong, should be += voiceCreditsToAllocate
        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;

        // more code ...
    }
```
### Coded POC
1. Add the following getter function to `QVBaseStrategy.sol`
```solidity
function getAllocatorVoiceCreditsCastToRecipient(address allocator, address recipient) external returns(uint256) {
        return allocators[allocator].voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[recipient];
    }
```
2. Add the following test function in `QVSimpleStrategy.t.sol`
3. Execute with forge  `test --match-test testWrongVoiceCreditsToRecipient -vv `
4. Output - the voice credits that are cast are 30 instead of 20
```solidity
function testWrongVoiceCreditsToRecipient() public {
        
        // register recipient
        address recipientId = __register_accept_recipient();

        vm.warp(registrationEndTime + 10);

        address[] memory recipientIds = new address[](1);
        recipientIds[0] = recipientId;

        // fund pool
        uint256[] memory amounts = new uint256[](1);
        amounts[0] = 9.9e17; // fund amount: 1e18 - fee: 1e17 = 9.9e17

        token.mint(pool_manager1(), 100e18);
        // set the allowance for the transfer
        vm.prank(pool_manager1());
        token.approve(address(allo()), 999999999e18);

        vm.prank(pool_manager1());
        allo().fundPool(poolId, 1e18);

        vm.warp(allocationStartTime + 10);

        address allocator = randomAddress();
        vm.startPrank(pool_manager1());
        qvSimpleStrategy().addAllocator(allocator);
        bytes memory allocateData = __generateAllocation(recipientId, 10);

        // allocate 10 credits
        vm.startPrank(address(allo()));
        qvSimpleStrategy().allocate(allocateData, randomAddress());

        console.log("Voice Credits Cast To After 1st allocate()", qvSimpleStrategy().getAllocatorVoiceCreditsCastToRecipient(randomAddress(), recipientId));
        
        // allocate 10 more credits, however allocator now has credited a wrong 30 credits to the recipient
        vm.startPrank(address(allo()));
        qvSimpleStrategy().allocate(allocateData, randomAddress());

        console.log("Voice Credits Cast To After 2st allocate()", qvSimpleStrategy().getAllocatorVoiceCreditsCastToRecipient(randomAddress(), recipientId));

    }
```
## Impact
This will lead to an inflated `_recipient.totalVotesReceived` and will cause wrong vote accounting for any subsequent `allocate()` executions

## Recommendation
Rework the accounting to such `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] = totalCredits;`
