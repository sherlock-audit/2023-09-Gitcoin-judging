# registerRecipient won't work when useRegistryAnchor is true
## Summary

In the function _registerRecipient in RFPSimpleStartegy.sol when useRegistryAnchor is true, the function will always fail resulting in recipients unable to register.

## Vulnerability Detail

if useRegistryAnchor is true, the variable recipientAddress will never be set, which makes the condition in line 363 that checks if it is not 0, will always fail, resulting in a revert.

## Impact

RFPSimpleStartegy with useRegistryAnchor enabled will not work as they won't be able to receive recipients.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set the recipientAddress variable when useRegistryAnchor is true.
