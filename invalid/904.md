# Unauthorized users can become recipients in the `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionDirectTransferStrategy` strategy
Unauthorized users can become recipients in the `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionDirectTransferStrategy` strategy.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionDirectTransferStrategy` strategy, there is an vulnerability where unauthorized users can become recipients. Specifically, the `_registerRecipient()` function lacks robust validation checks against user inputs. When `useRegistryAnchor = false`, any user can set `registryAnchor` to `address(0)`. This will make `isUsingRegistryAnchor` to be equal to `false`, allowing the subsequent checks for profile membership to be bypassed.

As a result, a user who is not a profile member can set `registryAnchor = address(0)` and cause `isUsingRegistryAnchor` to evaluate to `false`. The transaction won't revert even if the user isn't a valid profile member, thereby allowing unauthorized registration of recipients.

## Impact
Unauthorized users may be able to register as recipients, thereby getting access to funds or benefits they shouldn't be entitled to. This can undermine the integrity of the entire distribution process.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is recommended to enforce strict checks on profile membership regardless of the value of `isUsingRegistryAnchor`. Here are two potential solutions:

1. **Separate Checks**: 
   - First, ensure that the user is a profile member. If not, revert immediately.
   - Then, check if a registry anchor is being used and validate accordingly.

```solidity
if (!_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) {
    revert UNAUTHORIZED();
}
if (isUsingRegistryAnchor && registryAnchor == address(0)) {
    revert INVALID_REGISTRY_ANCHOR();
}
```

2. **Combined Check**:
   - Ensure that if not using a registry anchor, the user must be a profile member to proceed.

```solidity
if (!isUsingRegistryAnchor && !_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) {
    revert UNAUTHORIZED();
}
```

Both solutions aim to ensure that only valid profile members can register as recipients, upholding the integrity of the distribution process.
