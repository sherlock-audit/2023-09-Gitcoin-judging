# Not paying the fee during funding
Not paying the fee during funding.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user wants to fund a pool, he needd to pay a tax, which is sent to the treasury. Let's assume that your `pool.token` is `NATIVE`, `percentFee` is `1e16` and `_amount` is equal to 5eth (which is 5e18 in value). The `feeAmount` will be `0.05e18` and `amountAfterFee` will be `4.95e18`. To transfer the fees, the _transferAmountFrom function is called and the following checks must be passed:

```solidity
if (_token == NATIVE) {
            // Native Token
            if (msg.value < amount) revert AMOUNT_MISMATCH();
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferETH(_transferData.to, amount);

        } else {
            SafeTransferLib.safeTransferFrom(_token, _transferData.from, _transferData.to, amount);
        }
        return true;
```

`msg.value < amount` should be less than the fee. In your case, the fees will be `0.05e18` and `4.95e18`. A user can easily bypass these checks by sending just `4.95e18` instead of `5 eth`. So, if he calls the `fundPool` function with `_amount = 5e18` and `msg.value = 4.95e18`, he will not pay the fee.

## Impact
Protocol will lose  money from not paying of fee plus losing of eth from balance of `Allo` contract.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L509-L516

```solidity
    function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        //@note fee can be skipped during creating
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount; // 5 eth  msg.value = 0.05, baseFee = 0,

        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token; // NATIVE

        if (percentFee > 0) { //note is this bigger than 0 when baseFee > 0
           
            // percentageFee = 1% = 1e16
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            // 5e18 - 0.05e18
            
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;

            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }

        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);

        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```

## Recommendation
Check if `msg.value`  is bigger or equal to `_amount`
