# In ` QVBaseStrategy` there is now option to reallocate voice credits that are allocated once
## Summary
Once an allocator allocates one of his voice credits to a recipient, he is not able to withdraw his votes again and allocate the voice credit to another recipient 


## Vulnerability Detail

By calling `_qv_allocate`, a user can allocate some of his voting credits and the corresponding votes to a recipient. In case he changes his mind and wants to allocate his voting credits to another recipient, there is no way to withdraw his votes and the corresponding voting credit.



## Impact

If an allocator changes his mind on who he wants to allocate his voice credits to, he cannot withdraw the votes and the corresponding vote credit from the old recipient. This can lead to the wrong recipients getting the pool money if, for example some bad news comes out about one recipient a lot of allocators already voted for.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a function like `withdrawAllocation` to enable the allocators to withdraw an already allocated vote credit from a recipient.
