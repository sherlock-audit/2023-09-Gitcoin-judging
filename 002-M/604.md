# Accounting Issues due to Fee on Transfer Tokens
## Summary
The webpage of the audit states that 
> Fee on transfer  tokens will be allowed on the Allo  protocol and watsons will be able to submit issues concerning this.

The protocol doesn’t take measures to guard themselves from accounting issues that could rise due to fee on transfer tokens. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Fee on transfer tokens take a fee when being transferred and the actual amount inputted isn’t the actual amount seen by the contract thereby wrong values will be deducted from underlying state variables.
## Impact
This could cause serious accounting issues when fee on transfer tokens are used. Causing huge loss to the protocol. I say it’s a medium.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When tokens are being transferred the actual amount gotten should be calculated and accounted for in the respective state variables.
