# Voice credits cast to recipient is incorrectly accounted in QVBaseStrategy contract
## Summary
In `QVBaseStrategy::_qv_allocate()` function logics, allocator's voice credits cast to a recipient is improperly accounted

## Vulnerability Detail
`QVBaseStrategy::_qv_allocate()` lets an allocator allocating voice credits to a recipient. In the function, vote result is computed from allocator's total credits and then added to `totalRecipientVotes` and `_recipient.totalVotesReceived`. After that, allocator's states would get updated. 
Here, `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits` is an incorrect storage update while the additional voice credits cast to recipient is just `_voiceCreditsToAllocate`

## Impact
1. Since `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` get accounted improperly, vote results would get calculated wrongly ==> payout amounts get miscalculated, accordingly. Equivalently, it could be attacks to manipulate vote results and payout amounts
2. Function `QVSimpleStrategy::_hasVoiceCreditsLeft()` does not return as expected

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` should be increased by `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` instead of `totalCredits`:
```diff
- _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits
+ _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += _voiceCreditsToAllocate
```
