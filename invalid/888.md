# Timestamp verification flaw in _isPoolTimestampValid function
## Summary

The **_isPoolTimestampValid** function has an oversight in its timestamp verification logic, resulting in potential unintended behavior when determining the validity of pool timestamps.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function **_isPoolTimestampValid** checks the validity of the provided timestamps to ensure they follow a logical sequence. While the function verifies most timestamp conditions, it overlooks a critical condition: ensuring that the **_allocationStartTime** is not less than the **_registrationEndTime**. This means a situation can arise where allocation can start even before registration has ended, causing potential inconsistencies and disruptions in the expected workflow.

## Impact

Failure to enforce the correct sequence of timestamps can lead to operational issues, user confusion, and potential misuse of the system. Specifically, users might be allocated resources before the registration period ends, which could unfairly impact late registrants.

Example:

Suppose the following timestamps are provided:

-  block.timestamp: 500
- _registrationStartTime: 1000
- _registrationEndTime: 2000
- _allocationStartTime: 1500
- _allocationEndTime: 2500

- block.timestamp > _registrationStartTime (500 > 1000): false
- _registrationStartTime > _registrationEndTime (1000 > 2000): false
-  _registrationStartTime > _allocationStartTime (1000 > 1500): false
- _allocationStartTime > _allocationEndTime (1500 > 2500): false
-  _registrationEndTime > _allocationEndTime (2000 > 2500): false

In this scenario, the allocation process begins at timestamp 1500, even though registration doesn't conclude until timestamp 2000. This overlap can lead to disruptions and discrepancies in allocation.

## Recommendation

Add a condition to check that **_allocationStartTime** is not less than **_registrationEndTime**.
