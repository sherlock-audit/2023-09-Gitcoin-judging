# Potential Denial of Service (DoS) in Strategies due to Underfunded Pool During Distribution.
## Summary
Potential Denial of Service (DoS) in Strategies due to Underfunded Pool During Distribution.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the all Strategies, the logic for fund distribution calculates each recipient's pay amounts. This approach, although robust in most scenarios, does not factor in situations where the pool might be underfunded. There's no explicit check in all strategies to ensure that the total amount due for all distributions is less than or equal to the actual available funds in the strategies (actual NATIVE tokens or actual ERC20 tokens amount). Additionally, the capability to update pool timestamps and possibly re-enter the allocation phase in `QVBaseStrategy` without adjusting the `poolAmount` further exacerbates this problem.

## Impact
If the strategies attempts a distribution when the strategy is underfunded, transactions may fail and revert, essentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). This would render the remaining funds in the pool inaccessible. Users who are rightfully expecting a distribution might find themselves unable to access their due, resulting in potential financial losses and undermining trust in the system.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. **Sufficient Balance Check:** Before any distribution, implement a function that calculates the total funds required for the distribution and checks it against the actual available amount in strategy.
2. **Lock During Distribution:** Ensure that once the distribution phase starts, no alterations to the pool's metadata or its state can be made.
