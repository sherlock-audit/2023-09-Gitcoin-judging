# DOS - Users will not be able to create pool when `baseFee` will be greater than `0`.
## Summary

Users who will send the exact amount of (fee + amount) will face the DOS issue and will not be able to create pools in the `Allo` contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `createPool` and `createPoolWithCustomStrategy` functions of the `Allo` contract allow users to create a new pool and internally these functions call the internal `_createPool` function.

```solidity
// Returns the created pool ID
return
    _createPool(
        _profileId,
        IStrategy(Clone.createClone(_strategy, _nonces[msg.sender]++)),
        _initStrategyData,
        _token,
        _amount,
        _metadata,
        _managers
    );
```

The `_createPool` function creates the pool, assigns the roles, initializes the strategy and then checks whether the `baseFee` is greater than `0` or not.

If it is greater than `0` then it checks one of the two conditions:

1. If the `_token` is a `NATIVE` token and the `baseFee + _amount` is greater than or equal to `msg.value` then it should revert.

OR

2. If the `_token` is **not** `NATIVE` and `baseFee` is greater than or equal to `msg.value` then it should revert.

### Bug

But here is the issue, these conditions `reverts` when the `msg.value` is `equal`.

Instead, these should `revert` when `msg.value` is less than `baseFee + amount` (in the case when `_token` == `NATIVE`) or `baseFee` (in the case when `_token` != `NATIVE`).

## Code Snippet

```solidity
if (baseFee > 0) {
    // To prevent paying the baseFee from the Allo contract's balance
    // If _token is NATIVE, then baseFee + _amount should be >= than msg.value.
    // If _token is not NATIVE, then baseFee should be >= than msg.value.
    if (
        (_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) ||
        (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)
    ) {
        revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
    }

    _transferAmount(NATIVE, treasury, baseFee);

    emit BaseFeePaid(poolId, baseFee);
}
```

## Impact

If we take the rough estimation then only 10% to 20% of users can deposit more than the required amount, all the others will send the exact amount of (fee + amount) for the pool. All those users will face the DOS issue and will not be able to create pools.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The conditions should only revert when the `msg.value` is less than required (fee + amount).

```diff
if (
-   (_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) ||
+   (_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount > msg.value)) ||
-   (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)
+   (_token != NATIVE && baseFee > msg.value)
) {
    revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
}
```
