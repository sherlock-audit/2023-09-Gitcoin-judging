# Improper Sequence of Operations in Claim Function
## Summary
The claim function in the `DonationVotingMerkleDistributionVaultStrategy` contract deletes a claim from the mapping before transferring the tokens to the recipient. This could potentially lead to a situation where a claim is deleted but the tokens are not successfully transferred if the `_transferAmount` function were to fail for some reason.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the claim function, the sequence of operations is as follows:
```solidity
// Delete the claim from the mapping
delete claims[singleClaim.recipientId][singleClaim.token];

// Transfer the tokens to the recipient
_transferAmount(token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
```
Here, the claim is deleted from the mapping before the tokens are transferred. If the `_transferAmount` function fails for any reason (for example, if the contract doesn't have enough tokens), the claim would be deleted without the tokens being transferred.
## Impact
 This could lead to a loss of funds for the recipient. If a claim is deleted and the token transfer fails, the recipient would lose their claim without receiving the tokens they are entitled to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The sequence of operations should be reversed. The tokens should be transferred before the claim is deleted. This way, if the token transfer fails, the claim still exists in the mapping and the operation can be retried. The corrected sequence should look like this:
```solidity
// Transfer the tokens to the recipient
_transferAmount(token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

// Delete the claim from the mapping
delete claims[singleClaim.recipientId][singleClaim.token];
```
This ensures that a recipient's claim is only deleted after they have successfully received their tokens.
