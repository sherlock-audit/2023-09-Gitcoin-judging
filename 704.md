# When calling `QVBaseStrategy._qv_allocate`, the variable `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` is not updated correctly
## Summary
When calling `QVBaseStrategy._qv_allocate`, the variable `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` is not updated correctly resulting in the allocation of to many votes if it is called three or more times for the same recipientID



## Vulnerability Detail

When a use calls `_qv_allocate` to allocate new voting credits to an recipient, the voting credits the allocator has already casted to a recipient are added to the `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` this time. This sum (`totalCredits`) is shared and the result is used to calculate the number of additional votes the recipient should receive. Once the appropriate number of new votes are added to the recipient the number of voiceCredits the allocator has allocated to the recipient are updated. This update is not made properly because instead of adding the newly allocated voice credits (`_voiceCreditsToAllocate` ) to `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]`, the `totalCredits` are added. This results in a value for `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` that is to high and will result in to many votes casted for the recipient if `_qv_allocate` is called more than 2 times for the same recipient.

Example:

Allocators can cast a max of 9 voice credits resulting in a maximum of 3 votes for one recipient.
Allice is an allocator and allocates 1 voice credit to the recipient Bob. The votes she gives to him are sqrt(1) = 1 and  `Alice.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[Bob]` = 1.

Now Allice cast 3 additional voice credit to Bob:

`_voiceCreditsToAllocate ` = 3
`Alice.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[Bob]` = 1
`totalCredits` = `voiceCreditsToAllocate` + `Alice.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[Bob]` =1+3 = 4
Votes cast to Bob = sqrt(4) = 2
Updated `Alice.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[Bob]` = `Alice.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[Bob]` + `totalCredits` = 1 + 4 = 5

Alice casts her last 5 voice credit to Bob:

`_voiceCreditsToAllocate ` = 5
`Alice.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[Bob]` = 5
`totalCredits` = `voiceCreditsToAllocate` + `Alice.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[Bob]` =5+5 = 10
Votes cast to Bob = sqrt(10) = 3.16 
The result is that Alice managed to give 3.16 votes to Bob even though she was only supposed to be able to give a max of 3 votes to any one recipient. (in the contract, voice credits are multiplied by  1e18 to calculate the number of votes. The decimal number as a result is for simplicity) 



## Impact
Allocators can allocate each of their voting credits one at the time to their favourite recipient and thereby inflate the number of votes they are giving to him. This way they can give more votes to the recipients that they should be able to.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the variable `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId]` properly by adding `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` instead of `totalCredits`
