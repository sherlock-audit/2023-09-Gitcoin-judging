# `RFPSimpleStrategy#_distribute` does not check the status of `milestone` as `pending`, which allows rejected (`Status.Rejected`) or unsubmitted milestones to still be paid.
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

As the pool may have many managers, this may result in one manager mistakenly distributing funds to a recipient who has their most recent milestone rejected by another pool manager.
