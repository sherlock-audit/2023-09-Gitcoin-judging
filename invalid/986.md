# QVSimpleStrategy.removeAllocator() fails to remove the votes casted by the allocator, leading to unfair fund distribution.
``QVSimpleStrategy.removeAllocator()`` fails to remove the votes casted by the allocator. As a result, the vote information will be wrong after the allocator is removed and fund distribution will be unfair - some recipients will receive less funds than they are supposed to.

## Vulnerability Detail

``QVSimpleStrategy.removeAllocator()``  will remove an allocator: 

[https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L97-L101](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/strategies/qv-simple/QVSimpleStrategy.sol#L97-L101)

However, the votes by the allocator has already been casted by function ``_allocate()``:

``QVSimpleStrategy.removeAllocator()``  fails to modify: 

1) ``totalRecipientVotes``;

2) the votes for the recipients that the removed allocator has voted:  ``_recipient.totalVotesReceived``. 

As a result, the payout for each recipient, ``poolAmount * recipient.totalVotesReceived / totalRecipientVotes;`` will not be calculated correctly, leading to some unfair fund distribution. 

## Impact

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Both the  ``totalRecipientVotes`` and ``_recipient.totalVotesReceived`` should be decreased accordingly when an allocator is removed.
