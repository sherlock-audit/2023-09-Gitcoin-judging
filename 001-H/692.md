# setPoolActive() function of `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol` can be called by anyone
The `setPoolActive()` function in the `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol ` contract is vulnerable to unauthorized access, allowing any external address to call the function and change the pool's active status.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the `setPoolActive()` function lacks proper access control. It does not enforce restrictions on who can call it, which means any external address can invoke this function, potentially causing unintended changes to the contract's state.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability could be severe. Without proper access control, any external actor can toggle the pool's status, This vulnerability could disrupt the intended operation of the contract and result in financial losses or instability.

## Code Snippet

```solidity

function setPoolActive(bool _flag) external {
    _setPoolActive(_flag);
    emit PoolActive(_flag);
}
```
