# Gas grief possible on unsafe external calls
## Summary
Gas grief possible on unsafe external calls

## Vulnerability Detail
In Solidity, the use of low-level `call` methods can expose contracts to gas griefing attacks. The potential problem arises when the callee contract returns a large amount of data. This data is allocated in the memory of the calling contract, which pays for the gas costs. If the callee contract intentionally returns an enormous amount of data, the gas costs can skyrocket, causing the transaction to fail due to an Out of Gas error. Therefore, it's advisable to limit the use of `call` when interacting with untrusted contracts, or ensure that the callee's returned data size is capped or known in advance to prevent unexpected high gas costs. 
Now `(bool success, )` is actually the same as writing `(bool success, bytes memory data)` which basically means that even though the data is omitted it doesn't mean that the contract does not handle it. Actually, the way it works is the `bytes data` that was returned from the receiver will be copied to memory. Memory allocation becomes very costly if the payload is big

## Impact
lost of gas fees

## Code Snippet

```solidity

    function execute(address _target, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) external returns (bytes memory) {
        // Check if the caller is the owner of the profile and revert if not
        if (!registry.isOwnerOfProfile(profileId, msg.sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();

        // Check if the target address is the zero address and revert if it is
        if (_target == address(0)) revert CALL_FAILED();

        // Call the target address and return the data
        (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_data);

        // Check if the call was successful and revert if not
        if (!success) revert CALL_FAILED();

        return data;
    }

```
