# RFPSimpleStrategy._distribute will revert in most cases
## Summary

A recipient will specify a proposalBid when registering, which indicates all the funds required. If a recipient is selected as `acceptedRecipientId` by the pool manager, the pool manager will set milestones for it. Funds will be distributed every time acceptedRecipient reaches a milestone (the amount is a percentage of all funds).

RFPSimpleStrategy._distribute has an internal check to make sure it has enough funds to distribute funds for the current milestone. This check is fine for the first milestone, but subsequent milestones will revert due to `NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS`.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: contracts\strategies\rfp-simple\RFPSimpleStrategy.sol
417:     function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
......
428:         Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
429:         Recipient memory recipient = _recipients[acceptedRecipientId];
430:         
431:         // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
432:->       if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
433: 
434:         // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
435:->       uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;
436: 
437:         // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
438:->       poolAmount -= amount;
439:         _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);
......
445:         upcomingMilestone++;
......
450:     }
```

After `_distribute` is called, `poolAmount` will be subtracted by `amount` required for this milestone. And `recipient.proposalBid` represents all the funds required by the project, which is the sum of all milestones. Then, when _distribute is called for the second time, `recipient.proposalBid` must be greater than `poolAmount`, which will cause L432 revert.

Consider the following scenario:

For simplicity, assume there are 2 milestones, the first milestone has a percentage of 30%, and the second milestone has a percentage of 70%. recipient.proposalBid = poolAmount = 100 ether.

1.  When the first milestone is completed, the pool manager calls `distribute` to distribute funds to the recipient. The values of each variable in the process are as follows:
    
    ```status
    L432, recipient.proposalBid = poolAmount = 100, so if condition is not met.
    L435, amount = 100 * 30% = 30
    L438, poolAmount = 100 - 30 = 70
    ```
    
2.  When the second milestone is completed, the pool manager calls `distribute` to distribute funds to the recipient. This time tx will revert at L432.
    
    ```status
    L432, recipient.proposalBid = 100, poolAmount = 70, so if condition is met. tx will revert.
    ```
    

Therefore, funds required by subsequent milestones cannot be distributed to recipients via `distrbute`.

## Impact

If `acceptedRecipientId` has multiple milestones, the pool manager can successfully distribute funds to recipient for the first milestone. Due to this problem, the pool manager cannot distribute funds for subsequent milestones and will revert. This breaks core function of protocol.
