# Add default constructor that calls _disableInitializers()
## Summary

Malicious actor can initialize implementation contract of a proxy by calling **initialize()**. For example if the implementation contract makes a controlled delegatecall or performs self-destruct, itâ€™s possible to delete the implementation.

## Vulnerability Detail

When using OpenZeppelin's UUPS model, an uninitialized implementation contract can be vulnerable to takeover by attackers using the initialize function. Therefore, it's advised to call the _disableInitializers method within the constructor to safeguard the implementation contract from malicious actors. Notably, contracts that implement the OwnablePausableUpgradeable pattern often overlook the inclusion of _disableInitializers in their constructors.

## Impact

When an implementation contains a potentially harmful function, the impact can be critical. However, given the likelihood of exploitation, the overall risk is assessed as medium.

## Recommendation

Constructor of the implementation contract should call _disableInitializers() [function](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol#L181).
