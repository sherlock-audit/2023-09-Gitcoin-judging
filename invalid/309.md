# RFPSimpleStrategy.sol#_distribute() Milestone status is not checked
Milestone status is not checked on distribution

## Vulnerability Detail
In _distribute function milestones are distributed to the recipient. Only the milestones with pending status should be distributed, however, there is no check for the milestone status. The problem here is that even though a milestone was rejected, it can be distributed without any problem.

## Impact
A rejected milestone can be distributed

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {
        // check to make sure there is a pending milestone
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();


        IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        Recipient memory recipient = _recipients[acceptedRecipientId];


        // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
        if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();


        // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
        uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;


        // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
        poolAmount -= amount;
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);


        // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;


        // Increment the upcoming milestone
        upcomingMilestone++;


        // Emit events for the milestone and the distribution
        emit MilestoneStatusChanged(upcomingMilestone, Status.Accepted);
        emit Distributed(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check that the milestone status is pending
```solidity
if (milestone.milestoneStatus != Status.Pending) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();
```
