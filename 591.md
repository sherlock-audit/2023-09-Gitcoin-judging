# When `useRegistryAnchor` is true, RFPSimpleStrategy is bricked and all calls to `_registerRecipient` will revert
## Summary

The RFPSimpleStrategy contract has the option of whether or not to use `useRegistryAnchor`, which will affect the logic when registering recipients. An issue arises when `useRegistryAnchor` is `true`, where all calls to `_registerRecipient` will revert resulting in the contract functionality being completely bricked and unusable.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `_registerRecipient` function is defined as follows:
```solidity
function _registerRecipient(bytes memory _data, address _sender)
    internal
    override
    onlyActivePool
    returns (address recipientId)
{
    bool isUsingRegistryAnchor;
    address recipientAddress;
    address registryAnchor;
    uint256 proposalBid;
    Metadata memory metadata;

    // Decode '_data' depending on the 'useRegistryAnchor' flag
    if (useRegistryAnchor) {
        /// @custom:data when 'true' -> (address recipientId, uint256 proposalBid, Metadata metadata)
        (recipientId, proposalBid, metadata) = abi.decode(_data, (address, uint256, Metadata));

        // If the sender is not a profile member this will revert
        if (!_isProfileMember(recipientId, _sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
    } else {
        ...
    }

    ...

    // If the recipient address is the zero address this will revert
    if (recipientAddress == address(0)) revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId); // @issue

    ...
}
```
When `useRegistryAnchor` is set to `true`, we run through the first branch of the if-statement, where we can see that `recipientAddress` is not set to anything. Since it is defined outside of this if-statement, its value will remain as address(0). Then later, we see that if `recipientAddress` is address(0), it will revert. Thus, this function will always revert.

## Impact

When `useRegistryAnchor` is `true`, all calls to `_registerRecipient` will revert, and since that's a core component to the RFPSimpleStrategy, effectively all logic is bricked.

## Recommendation

When `useRegistryAnchor` is `true`, `recipientAddress` should also be included in the `_data` passed to the `_registerRecipient` function.
