# Revert on exact amount
## Summary
The Allo contract has a _createPool() function which let's users create their own pools. User specifies the amount he wants to deposit into the pool. There's a condition that checks if the user has provided enough msg.value to cover `baseFee + amount`.  


## Vulnerability Detail 
The problem is that if a user provides **exactly** the amount needed the function would revert leading to user confusion.

## Impact
User confusion.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
It would be better to use `>` instead of `>=`. That way the transaction won't revert on exact amount provided.
