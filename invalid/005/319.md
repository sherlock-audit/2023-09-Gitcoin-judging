# Rejecting and submitting milestones is useless
## Summary

In `RFPSimpleStrategy` a pool manager can reject a milestone and an accepted recipient can submit a milestone.

## Vulnerability Detail

The problem is that the `_distribute` function which is supposed to distribute funds based on the current `upcomingMilestone`, the function doesn't have any checks if a milestone has been rejected or even submitted.

```solidity
   function _distribute(address[] memory, bytes memory, address _sender)
        internal
        virtual
        override
        onlyInactivePool
        onlyPoolManager(_sender)
    {
        //@audit this doesn't check statues of milestones, it only checks if milestones have been set
        // check to make sure there is a pending milestone
        if (upcomingMilestone >= milestones.length) revert INVALID_MILESTONE();

        IAllo.Pool memory pool = allo.getPool(poolId);
        Milestone storage milestone = milestones[upcomingMilestone];
        Recipient memory recipient = _recipients[acceptedRecipientId];

        // make sure has enough funds to distribute based on the proposal bid
        if (recipient.proposalBid > poolAmount) revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();

        // Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
        uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;

        
        // Get the pool, subtract the amount and transfer to the recipient
        poolAmount -= amount;
        _transferAmount(pool.token, recipient.recipientAddress, amount);

        // Set the milestone status to 'Accepted'
        milestone.milestoneStatus = Status.Accepted;

        // Increment the upcoming milestone
        upcomingMilestone++;

        // Emit events for the milestone and the distribution
        emit MilestoneStatusChanged(upcomingMilestone, Status.Accepted);
        emit Distributed(acceptedRecipientId, recipient.recipientAddress, amount, _sender);
    }

```

## Impact

Milestones can be distributed anytime no matter their status.

## Recommendation
Add check to see if a milestone has been submitted/rejected
