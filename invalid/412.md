# The contract lacks the emission of events, which can hinder the ability to track and monitor contract activities
The contract lacks the emission of events, which can hinder the ability to track and monitor contract activities. Events are essential for transparency, debugging, and external monitoring of contract interactions.

## Vulnerability Detail
there are no event declarations or emissions. Events serve as an important mechanism to log and communicate significant contract activities to external systems or users. Without events, it becomes challenging to obtain insights into the contract's operations, making it less transparent and more difficult to diagnose issues.

## Impact
The absence of events can have the following impacts:
1. Reduced Transparency: Users and external systems cannot easily monitor and track contract activities, making it challenging to understand how the contract is being used.
2. Debugging Difficulties: Debugging and diagnosing issues within the contract become more complicated without event logs to provide insights into contract execution.
3. Limited External Integration: External applications or systems that rely on event logs for monitoring and analysis will face limitations in their ability to interact effectively with the contract.


## Code Snippet
EG:
Source from the beginning of code in this file
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-Gitcoin/blob/main/allo-v2/contracts/core/Registry.sol#L40

```solidity
// Define an event for contract activities
event Execution(address indexed profileOwner, address indexed target, uint256 value, bytes data);

function execute(address _target, uint256 _value, bytes memory _data) external returns (bytes memory) {
    if (!registry.isOwnerOfProfile(profileId, msg.sender)) revert UNAUTHORIZED();
    
    // Execute the call
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = _target.call{value: _value}(_data);
    
    // Log the contract activity
    emit Execution(msg.sender, _target, _value, _data);
    
    if (!success) revert CALL_FAILED();

    return data;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To enhance transparency, monitoring, and debugging capabilities, consider adding events to log important contract activities. This can include events for function executions, state changes, or other critical actions within the contract. Properly documented and well-designed events provide valuable insights into contract operations and facilitate better integration with external systems and applications.
