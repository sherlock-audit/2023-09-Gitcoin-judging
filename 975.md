# 0 amount will be distributed if `recipient.proposalBid` is very low
## Summary

No amount will be distributed if `recipient.proposalBid` is very low and always round down to 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `RFPSimpleStrategy.sol`, the distribution logic involves using milestones by which the pool amount is divided by the `milestone.amountPercentage`**.**

The exact line of code:

```solidity
// Calculate the amount to be distributed for the milestone
uint256 amount = (recipient.proposalBid * milestone.amountPercentage) / 1e18;
```

The strategy can have multiple milestones, but their `amountPercentage` sum must add up to 1e18.

So the scenarios would be to have one with `amountPercentage` = 1e18 or multiples below 1e18 that add up to 1e18.

Let's look at a practical example:

1. User is registered with proposalBid = 15
2. Pool manager allocated him and he became **`acceptedRecipientId`**.
3. Pool manger set milestones (3 milestones).

    First with `amountPercentage` = 5% = 5e16 = **50,000,000,000,000,000**
    
    Second with `amountPercentage` = 50% = 50e17 = **500,000,000,000,000,000**
    
    Third with `amountPercentage` = 45% = 4.5e17 = **450,000,000,000,000,000**
    
4. **`acceptedRecipientId`** calls `submitUpcomingMilestone()`
5. Pool manager calls `_distribute()` and when the line of code above comes,
    
    15 * 50,000,000,000,000,000 = 750,000,000,000,000,000 / 1e18 will result in 0 in Solidity and the distributed amount will be 0.
    

## Impact

Take the example above and consider that if we have 20 milestones with amountPercentage = 5%, if all milestones go through `distribute()` no amount will actually be distributed.

## Recommendation
It is difficult to give an exact recommendation because there are many things that this depends on and cannot be sure, but it is nice to have a minimum value of the parameter or to change the percentage performance at all.
