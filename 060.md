# Allocator who allocates additional votes to same recipient can provide more votes
## Summary
Allocator who allocates additional votes to same recipient can provide more votes, because of wrong calculations.
## Vulnerability Detail
`QVBaseStrategy._qv_allocate` function is responsible to allocate correct amount of votes to the user.

```solidity
    function _qv_allocate(
        Allocator storage _allocator,
        Recipient storage _recipient,
        address _recipientId,
        uint256 _voiceCreditsToAllocate,
        address _sender
    ) internal onlyActiveAllocation {
        // check the `_voiceCreditsToAllocate` is > 0
        if (_voiceCreditsToAllocate == 0) revert INVALID();


        // get the previous values
        uint256 creditsCastToRecipient = _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId];
        uint256 votesCastToRecipient = _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId];


        // get the total credits and calculate the vote result
        uint256 totalCredits = _voiceCreditsToAllocate + creditsCastToRecipient;
        uint256 voteResult = _sqrt(totalCredits * 1e18);


        // update the values
        voteResult -= votesCastToRecipient;
        totalRecipientVotes += voteResult;
        _recipient.totalVotesReceived += voteResult;


        _allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += totalCredits;
        _allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] += voteResult;


        // emit the event with the vote results
        emit Allocated(_recipientId, voteResult, _sender);
    }
```

In order to calculate amount of votes that user gets, function uses already allocated funds + current allocated funds and find root square of it. This total credits and total votes are `totalCredits` and `voteResult` variables.

Now user's total votes are updated correctly without already existed votes. But `_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient` and `_allocator.votesCastToRecipient` variables are increased with total credits and votes which is incorrect as they already contain part of those funds/votes.

As result when allocator will be allocating more credits to same recipient, then incorrect amount will be used as existing credit and votes, which will actually break calculations.
## Impact
Voting will not work correctly.

## Recommendation
Change to this
```solidity
_allocator.voiceCreditsCastToRecipient[_recipientId] = totalCredits;
_allocator.votesCastToRecipient[_recipientId] = voteResult;
```
