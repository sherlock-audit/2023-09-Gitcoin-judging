# One pool manager can review a same application multiple times to break design of ````reviewThreshold````
In ````QV```` based strategy, there is a design of ````reviewThreshold```` that an application would be ````Accepted```` or ````Rejected```` if ````review```` count reaches the ````reviewThreshold````. As my understanding, it's a security design similar to ````M of N```` multisig. Therefore, one pool manager should not be allowed to ````review```` on a same application repeatedly.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's look at the ````reviewRecipients()```` of ````QVBaseStrategy```` contract, there is no limit on multiple ````reviews```` from one manager to a same ````recipient````.
```solidity
File: contracts\strategies\qv-base\QVBaseStrategy.sol
254:     function reviewRecipients(address[] calldata _recipientIds, Status[] calldata _recipientStatuses)
255:         external
256:         virtual
257:         onlyPoolManager(msg.sender)
258:         onlyActiveRegistration
259:     {
260:         // make sure the arrays are the same length
261:         uint256 recipientLength = _recipientIds.length;
262:         if (recipientLength != _recipientStatuses.length) revert INVALID();
263: 
264:         for (uint256 i; i < recipientLength;) {
265:             Status recipientStatus = _recipientStatuses[i];
266:             address recipientId = _recipientIds[i];
267: 
268:             // if the status is none or appealed then revert
269:             if (recipientStatus == Status.None || recipientStatus == Status.Appealed) {
270:                 revert RECIPIENT_ERROR(recipientId);
271:             }
272: 
273:             reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus]++;
274: 
275:             if (reviewsByStatus[recipientId][recipientStatus] >= reviewThreshold) {
276:                 Recipient storage recipient = recipients[recipientId];
277:                 recipient.recipientStatus = recipientStatus;
278: 
279:                 emit RecipientStatusUpdated(recipientId, recipientStatus, address(0));
280:             }
281: 
282:             emit Reviewed(recipientId, recipientStatus, msg.sender);
283: 
284:             unchecked {
285:                 ++i;
286:             }
287:         }
288:     }

```

## Impact
If the ````reviewThreshold```` design is for scenario that pool manager role is only 99.99% but not 100% trusted by pool owner, then allowing to ````review```` repeatedly make the design meaningless.
