# `Allo.createPool` reverts on incorrect check for base fee, even when the perfect base fee is transferred
## Summary
`Allo.createPool` reverts on incorrect check for base fee, even when the perfect base fee is transferred 
## Vulnerability Detail
As given in documentation Allo charges base fee whenever new pool is created and revert if correct amount of base fees is not provided by caller.
1. Alice want to create a pool.
2. She calls [createPool](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L174) with correct amount of base fees i.e `msg.value==baseFee`
3. As current implementation , above function calls a internal method [_createPool](https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/0b881ef4a0013d2809374c9ea69f4cf1288dfe62/contracts/core/Allo.sol#L415) and it has below check to make sure correct base fee has been given
```solidity
File: contracts/core/Allo.sol
473            if ((_token == NATIVE && (baseFee + _amount >= msg.value)) || (_token != NATIVE && baseFee >= msg.value)) {
                revert NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS();
475            }
``` 
4. tx reverted (NOT_ENOUGH_FUNDS) due to incorrect check, even Alice gave correct/perfect amount of baseFee

## Impact
Alice won't able to create pool even after giving correct/proper baseFee

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Modify the check and don't revert on cases when baseFee==msg.value
