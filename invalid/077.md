# Users may lock themselves in Strategy contracts
https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/qv-base/QVBaseStrategy.sol#L87

https://github.com/allo-protocol/allo-v2/blob/851571c27df5c16f6586ece2a1cb6fd0acf04ec9/contracts/strategies/donation-voting-merkle-base/DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol#L363

In strategy contracts it is mentioned in comments the passed time must be in milliseconds while it is comparing it with block.timestamp wich is in seconds not milliseconds

## Vulnerability Detail

Pool managers should set `registrationStartTime` , `registrationEndTime`, `allocationStartTime` and `allocationEndTime` in order to use Strategy functionalities and it is mentioned in comments that passed value must be in milliseconds

DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol => Line 363 :
> @dev The timestamps are in milliseconds for the start and end times.

QVBaseStrategy.sol => Line 87 : 
> @dev The values will be in milliseconds since the epoch

This is while these values are compared to `block.timestamp` which is in seconds not milliseconds. after miliseconds values got set : in order to use Strategy functionalities `onlyActiveRegistration`, `onlyActiveAllocation` and  `onlyAfterAllocation` modifiers are used to check whether the called function is accessible or not, these modifiers make internal call and compare the milisecond values with block.timestam(seconds) and if the check fails the tx will revert.

For sure it will revert since miliseconds is *1000 bigger than seconds.

## Impact

Imagine a user who is told to pass the times as miliseconds want to set `registrationStartTime` to 10 days which is equal to 864,000,000
miliseconds, after seting it s/he want to call `_registerRecipient` which has `onlyActiveRegistration` modifier, this modifier checks the miliseconds with the current block.timestamp (seconds) in other words with the check you consider their value as seconds.

user wanted 10 days but  864,000,000 sec == 10000 days And the check will revert the call

This leads to user's strategy contract get locked if they don't notice the problem.

If you also have frontend web app which sends the times as miliseconds this will cause a problem too.

## Code Snippet

These are the interanl functions that's called from modifiers (it is the same in both DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy and QVBaseStrategy)
```solidity
File: allo-v2\contracts\strategies\donation-voting-merkle-base\DonationVotingMerkleDistributionBaseStrategy.sol
457:     function _checkOnlyActiveRegistration() internal view {
458:         if (registrationStartTime > block.timestamp || block.timestamp > registrationEndTime) {
459:             revert REGISTRATION_NOT_ACTIVE();
460:         }
461:     }
462: 
...
465:     function _checkOnlyActiveAllocation() internal view {
466:         if (allocationStartTime > block.timestamp || block.timestamp > allocationEndTime) {
467:             revert ALLOCATION_NOT_ACTIVE();
468:         }
469:     }
470: 
...
473:     function _checkOnlyAfterAllocation() internal view {
474:         if (block.timestamp < allocationEndTime) {
475:             revert ALLOCATION_NOT_ENDED();
476:         }
477:     }
```
