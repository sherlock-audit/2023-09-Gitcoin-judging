# Rebasing tokens used to fund pools are not properly accounted.
If rebasing tokens are used as tokens to fund the pool, rewards are accrued in the pool and will be stuck forever in the pool since the pool is not properly accounted.

## Impact
If rebasing tokens are used as tokens to fund the pool, rewards are accrued in the pool and will be stuck forever
## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;
        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;
        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;
            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);
        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```

Withdrawing from the pool is not accounting for the rewards accrued from the rebasing token, If rebasing tokens are used for funding the pool the rewards should be properly accounted for.

```solidity
  function _fundPool(uint256 _amount, uint256 _poolId, IStrategy _strategy) internal {
        uint256 feeAmount;
        uint256 amountAfterFee = _amount;
        Pool storage pool = pools[_poolId];
        address _token = pool.token;
        if (percentFee > 0) {
            feeAmount = (_amount * percentFee) / getFeeDenominator();
            amountAfterFee -= feeAmount;
            _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: treasury, amount: feeAmount}));
        }
        _transferAmountFrom(_token, TransferData({from: msg.sender, to: address(_strategy), amount: amountAfterFee}));
        _strategy.increasePoolAmount(amountAfterFee);
        emit PoolFunded(_poolId, amountAfterFee, feeAmount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Track total amounts currently funded and allow funders to withdraw excess on a pro-rata basis
